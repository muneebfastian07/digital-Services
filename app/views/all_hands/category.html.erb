Most recently he moved Datadog from a multi-floor office in New York’s Flatiron district to one single floor in The New York Times building in Times Square. Using a methodical approach honed from his past jobs and first office move, Matt worked extensively with his team to plan Datadog’s move and successfully orchestrated it over the course of a weekend. He also used the move as an opportunity to strengthen the company’s culture and create ways to foster team togetherness while respecting his colleagues’ different working styles. \n\nMoving an office requires strong communication and logistical skills, which Matt developed in a variety of roles before joining Datadog. After graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in psychology, he began his career as an Outside Sales Representative and Merchandiser at Anheuser-Busch, and then transitioned to work as an IT recruiter. While he was pursuing a recruiting position at a software services company in Jersey City, the company took a look at his background and asked if if he’d be interested in an operations management job. \n\n“That’s where my career fell into place,” Matt said. “All the pieces came together.”\n\n\n### Learning from the first office move\n\nHardly a week into the new job, the CFO informed him they had signed a lease on a new office across the street and he would need Matt’s help arranging the move. Matt rolled up his sleeves and got to work, first selecting the architect and designer who would oversee a redesign of the new office. Taking on a challenge like an office move was new for Matt, but in addition to the skills he’d developed on his past job, he'd had plenty of personal experience moving apartments and had learned much about designing spaces thanks to his avid viewing of HGTV. \n\nThe move was not easy. A few of Matt’s team members weren’t fully prepared for the hard work that was in store, and the end result was a rough transition into the new office.\n\n### Outgrowing their space\n\nMatt had enjoyed working in New York City for one of his IT recruiting jobs, so he began looking for jobs located in the city. He joined the Datadog operations team because the culture instantly felt like the right fit and he was excited about being at a fast growing company where he would have the opportunity to tackle another office move. When he started his new job Datadog was in the midst of signing a lease on a brand new space. But this time, Matt wouldn’t just be moving an office across the street, he’d be moving Datadog from a three floors to one floor in The New York Times building. \n\n“Our old office was kind of like a pre-war New York apartment,” said Matt. “You know — the floors creak, there’s no storage room. But you make the best of it and it has this great character to it.”\n\nDatadog occupied the 6th, 11th, and 12th Floors of this quirky building. Each floor had its own Slack channel for team communication, snack preferences, and unique personality within the larger Datadog culture. For example, the 12th floor was quieter, while the 6th floor tended to be more lively. \n\nIn addition, on every floor the company was outgrowing their tiny kitchenette areas, which were awkward to navigate and located too close to everyone’s work areas. Team members were constantly scrambling to find conference rooms and many meetings were held on the roof deck as a result. Matt spent his days constructing new IKEA tables to accommodate new hires. He even contemplated creative solutions like workstations hung from the ceiling to save space. Instead, a few employees were temporarily relocated to a coworking space when they ran out of room in the office. “Mo’ employees, mo’ problems,” joked Matt about the situation at their old office.\n\n### Preparing for the Move\n\nWith the big move to The New York Times building on 42nd Street and 8th Avenue, Matt was determined to learn from his past office move experience and prepare accordingly. \n\nOne of the first things he did was jot down everything in the office that would have to be transitioned or changed with the move. This included tasks like vendor deliveries, billing, change of address, returning in equipment, scheduling <a href=\"http://managedbyq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Managed by Q</a> to help clean after the move, and turning in the old keys to the landlord. Pascal Schaary, Datadog’s Director of Operations, added to it and ultimately the list became hundreds of items long. Once the list was complete, Matt and his team organized the items into their project management tool to better visualize everything that had to be done and prepared. \n\nHe and Pascal also toured the offices of several other tech companies to get a sense of what worked in those spaces and what did not. They asked their hosts what they would change, or organize differently in their office if they had the chance. For example, they learned that a proper kitchen set up was essential (and often neglected), and that employees rarely used remote coffee or beverage stations. Once they understood the basics of what they wanted from their new space, they worked with an architect who provided design and furniture suggestions. Datadog’s own design team handled designing the wall coverings and conference room signage. \n\nMatt stressed that hiring the right people and the right moving company was critical to the success of Datadog’s move. He had not previously worked with the moving company he ultimately chose, but they had multiple positive referrals. He was also impressed by the fact that they visited several times before the actual move to provide guidance and reassurance that everything would run smoothly on the big day. \n\n### Moving day\n\nThe company planned to move on a Friday. At 3pm on the Thursday before the move, Matt ensured that all of his coworkers received a moving box to pack and label, which would be delivered to the new space. On the day of the move all employees worked remotely while Matt and his team worked with the moving company to bring everything to the new office. Then they worked in the new office through the weekend to make sure the wifi, networks, phones, conference rooms, monitors, and everything else essential for business was up and running when their coworkers came in on Monday morning. \n\nThe hard work and preparation paid off. The first Monday in their new home Datadog employees were welcomed with breakfast and by 11am everyone was already working on their projects and taking conference calls. \n\n“People came up to me and said, ‘Wow, we left on Thursday, threw our stuff in a box, then we came in Monday and it was like nothing happened.’ And I’m like, ‘yeah, yeah this was definitely a piece of cake’,” said Matt, laughing.  \n\n### Strengthening company culture and communication in the new office\n\nFor Matt and his team a successful move to the new office wasn't just making sure employees’ work went undisrupted. It was also important to ensure that the essential aspects of the company’s culture were not lost in the new space. The unification had exciting prospects, but Matt realized it was also important to consider all the Datadog team members’ different working styles and the type of work environments they preferred. Now that everyone was together on the 45th floor of The New York Times building, Matt needed to envision how the company culture would meld together. He observed how people utilized the new office meeting rooms and break-out spaces, and listened to suggestions from his coworkers.  \n\nIn addition, the new building had a more polished feel, including tight security check-ins in the lobby. Plus, the Times Square location meant that everyone would have to look a little harder for good lunch and coffee options than they did when they were close to Madison Square Park. \n\nDatadog took all this into consideration and decided to focus its energy on expanding the dining area in the new office before they moved in. They doubled the size of the existing dining area by knocking out a conference room and work area. Appliance placement was also carefully planned, to make sure people would not always be crowded into the same location when they made coffee. Matt also made sure there were plenty of trashcans—something he had learned was important from visiting other offices. Now that everyone has settled in, the dining area is the central point where everyone comes to eat, snack, and catch up. The company also holds catered lunches three times a week at noon on the dot. And as an added benefit, it’s equipped with top-of-the-line coffee and espresso machines. \n\n“It’s the great meeting area now,” said Matt. “People will sit in there, hang out during the day, and work. It’s fantastic, because you see people who you didn’t see before. Having one floor and one central place for people to come, it really makes a huge difference on who you interact with.

Kaufman describes it as “a stale, chemical smell” and says he experienced headache and fatigue after a “smell day.”\n\nCountless students in chemistry, biology, and ecology have done lab work in the six-story building since its 1971 dedication. About 150 staffers work there, shut in by that windows that do not open. \n\nProfessor Joe DeFrank says he noticed the smell getting stronger and more frequent about two years ago, after a renovation project overturned some previously dormant material in the building. He says it caused him to feel dizzy, irritated his eyes, and left a “metal” taste in his mouth. “It’s one of the older buildings on campus,” he says, “and I don’t think it’s ducted to keep out the fumes.” He eventually moved his office to another building.\n\nThe university’s Environmental Health and Safety Office found that improper use of ventilation on the part of one lab group and the contractors may have caused the issue, according to UH spokesman Dan Meisenzahl. He says recent tests have shown all toxicity levels to be within state and federal safety standards. Meisenzahl adds, “There is no proof of anything in the building making anyone sick.”\n\nThe lack of definitive source for the purported symptoms in the St. John Plant Science Laboratory gives it hallmarks of Sick Building Syndrome (SBS). The phenomenon is <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/sick_building_factsheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">defined by the Environmental Protection Agency</a> as one “in which building occupants experience acute health and comfort effects that appear to be linked to time spent in a building, but no specific illness or cause can be identified.”\n\n“The symptoms are very subjective,” says Mark Mendell, an epidemiologist and affiliate staff scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “One person can blame it on the building where another wouldn’t. There is certainly a psychological component, but usually there is a [scientific] basis beneath it.” \n\nMendell, who has studied SBS extensively, says it’s common to buildings constructed in the mid-20th century, when basic building materials, like tiles and carpeting, were at peak toxicity. Low-level irritants, from paints, sealers and chemically treated plastics and vinyl, mix with years’ worth of cleaning products and the toxins people carry on them, such as deodorants, perfumes and residual tobacco smoke. Add some chronic dampness to the slow-boiling noxious stew and trap it in with poor ventilation and you have a constant source of watery eyes, sneezing, coughing, headaches, fatigue, and breathing issues. “It can seem like an allergy attack and the people who have allergies tend to show symptoms [of SBS] first,” says Mendell.\n\nBut there is no one identifiable source for the symptoms, so building owners and managers — who, in some cases, are also the employers of the people affected — often think those who complain are being overdramatic. “They often blame workers for being complainers and troublemakers,” says Mendell, “especially when no expert they’ve consulted can say it’s this specific chemical or that specific chemical.”\n\nSick Building Syndrome is especially prevalent in warm, damp climates, which explains why many of the first well-known cases happened in in Florida, where some workspaces become petri dishes of mold and fungus. A few expensive courthouses in the state <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-11/news/mn-33815_1_sick-building-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">were shut down</a> after occupants complained the settings were making them sick. But since the late ’70s cases of SBS have popped up everywhere — even in the home base of those fighting airborne toxins. Federal employees who work out of the EPA’s Region 9 Headquarters in San Francisco <a href=\"http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/San-Francisco-EPA-Workers-Claim-Office-is-a-Sick-Building-369331961.html\" target=\"_blank\">complained to union leaders</a> last year that the building was making them ill. \n\nWilliam J. Fisk, senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Indoor Environment Group, says it’s important to understand that all buildings are “sick” to some degree. “The phenomenon occurs in all buildings, to an extent,” says Fisk. It’s a mistake, he says, “to think of the issue of ‘sick buildings’ vs. ‘non-sick buildings,’ but to think of a continuum of issues that all people who work and live in buildings and breathe the air inside experience.” \n\nMendell says that builders should “plan early” to avoid SBS. This does not mean running towards a trendy “green” designation, he says. Some, such as Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) certification, address some environmental factors but don’t have much to do with indoor air quality. “People would often like to build a LEED building,” he says, “but LEED has few protections for workers.” \n\nInstead, ventilation is usually the key. Mendell says builders should be acutely aware of how easily their system lets out used air and excess moisture. Excessive efforts for climate control often interfere with ventilation. \n\nFor existing buildings that seem to be the source of sniffles, Mendell says owners should get the opinion of an indoor air expert. If they do not find anything visible and definitive (like radon or asbestos), the easiest fix is usually an upgrade of the ventilation system. \n\nUnfortunately, the solutions to SBS are rarely simple. In past cases, Mendell says he found that a building’s ventilation system was being corrupted because it was taking in air from a busy bus stop outside. The solution was moving the stop and sending its idling diesel buses down the street. Sometimes, humans and the chemicals they spread aren’t always the problem: In another instance, the culprit was bird nests in the building’s duct system. \n\n*Illustration by Tin Nguyen*","cover":{"title":"toxicworkplace orange border feed","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3vfFc2Rz168GMiwqi4IaOW/800c3ec96aa000e71ceb48d80a6e7ca8/mbq_ah_004_toxicworkplace_1200x800_orange.png","details":{"size":86240,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_004_toxicworkplace_1200x800_orange.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"coverId":"3vfFc2Rz168GMiwqi4IaOW","featuredImage":{"title":"toxicworkplace 1422x1608","description":"Illustration by Tin Nguyen","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/4fmBJLuj0IMeaGoScyoq6Q/06b17c4edc0e5316c0bf74d87f22b172/mbq_ah_004_toxicworkplace_1422x1608.png","details":{"size":118899,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_004_toxicworkplace_1422x1608.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"4fmBJLuj0IMeaGoScyoq6Q","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"xLEDxDEDhQo2Mgs8iAgi6","name":"Nick Keppler","shortBio":"Nick Keppler is a Pittsburgh-based freelance writer whose work has appeared in AlterNet, The Village Voice, Mental Floss, Men’s Health, Vice, and Slate.","headshotId":"6JE956zppC8S2gWY24eCik","headshotImage":{"title":"Nick Keppler author photo","description":"Nick Keppler author photo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/6JE956zppC8S2gWY24eCik/65db28a13504ca489f6a14739801b314/Nick-JRP_3396-1.jpg","details":{"size":408726,"image":{"width":1785,"height":1829}},"fileName":"Nick-JRP_3396-1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"slideshowImages":[]},{"id":"1cgixhsYSg6SO2YsSWIuAK","slug":"utopian-history-of-the-eight-hour-day","publicationDate":"2017-06-30T00:00-04:00","modifiedDate":"2017-06-30T18:45:52.377Z","type":"Feature","title":"The Utopian Vision of the Eight Hour Day","subtitle":"The traditional workweek has enormous influence on our culture, even as it applies to fewer American workers.","body":"The eight-hour workday means a lot to us. Even as fewer and fewer Americans actually abide by it and are employed in contract or freelance positions, the traditional workweek has had an enormous influence on our culture and the way we think about our jobs. The eight-hour day created the concepts of rush hour, prime time TV, and the sad desk salad. It has won the affection of communists and capitalists alike, and even, in its 9-to-5 form, became a byword for the whole experience of being a tax-paying adult. But how, and why, did this seemingly random amount of time become the bedrock of our modern routine?\n\nWe begin our story in the 19th century with an ambitious Welshman named Robert Owen. Owen sought balance in all aspects of his life. A self-made industrialist who owned cotton mills in Britain, he was the very portrait of capitalist success. At the same time, the way he operated his factories helped lay the groundwork for early socialist thinking. In 1810, he introduced the concept of an equally divided day for all employees at his cotton plant in New Lanark, Scotland: sleep eight hours, work eight hours, and play eight hours. The program was a hit with his workers (several hundred of whom were children), and the factory became world famous, host to visitors like Tsar Nicholas I and the economist Jeremy Bentham. Conditions at New Lanark were idyllic for the time, but, just as importantly, the factory was hugely profitable. \n\nAs word of Robert Owen’s utopian success spread through the rich intellectual soil of the mid-19th century, the eight hour workday became the holy grail of the growing labor movement. Owen gets extensive praise in Frederick Engels’ influential book Socialism, which was a must-read for early pioneers of the labor movement.\n\n“Whilst his competitors worked their people 13 or 14 hours a day, in New Lanark the working day was only eight hours...he turned [it] into a model colony, in which drunkenness, police, magistrates, lawsuits, poor laws, charity were unknown. And all this simply by placing the people in conditions worthy of human beings.”\n\n Karl Marx gave it a shoutout in the Communist Manifesto, making it one of the few beliefs he had in common with the US Congress, which mandated an eight hour day for all federal employees in 1868. The movement reached a fever pitch on May Day, 1886, a massive general strike that involved 350,000 workers across America, unified in their demand for an eight hour workday. The subsequent Haymarket Bombing, which left 11 dead, brought the campaign into the national spotlight.\n\nDespite all this momentum, the average American factory worker was still putting in <a href=\"https://eh.net/encyclopedia/hours-of-work-in-u-s-history/\" target=\"_blank\">61 hours a week</a> in 1890. Slow progress would come in the next few decades, as trade unions fought tooth and nail with industrialists to win the eight hour day for their members. It took a spiritual successor of Robert Owen to reconcile the warring factions.\n\nIn 1914, Henry Ford set an eight-hour, five-day workweek for all of his employees. Much like Owen, Ford was a utopian thinker who sought to mold his workers into model citizens, and a canny businessman who determined that assembly liners workers were most productive on eight hour shifts. Profits doubled in two years. As Ford’s profile rose in the 1920s, other industrialists rushed to copy him. Victory finally came when President Franklin Roosevelt introduced the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1937, which gradually set the maximum workweek at 40 hours and mandated overtime pay for anything extra.\n\nAfter World War II, the workforce shifted slowly from agricultural and manufacturing to office and service jobs. For middle class workers the 9-to-5 workday became the foundation of the high-powered postwar economy. Coming out of the exhausting years of the war, Americans began to dream of a future where they would work less and play more. They watched George Jetson drive his flying car to the office and return three hours later. They read, in the <a href=\"http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/how-experts-think-well-live-in-2000-a-d-1950-512628099\" target=\"_blank\">Associated Press</a>, to tell their children “not to be surprised if the year 2000 finds 35 or even a 20-hour work week fixed by law.” They had every reason to fantasize. In their own lifetime, they had seen the average workweek plummet from <a href=\"http://personal.lse.ac.uk/minns/Huberman_Minns_EEH_2007.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">58 hours in 1913 to 42 hours in 1950</a>. Postwar technology also pushed worker productuvity because a growing number of tasks could be completed without any human input.\n\nIn an alternate history, labor hours have continued to decline and in 2017 we've got a 20-hour workweek and we wonder what to do with all of our free time. Yoga classes are booked solid for months. Prestige TV shows now have 100 episodes a season. Kids complain about being in school longer than their parents are at work. \n\nBut that’s not what happened. Instead, working hours stabilized at around 40 a week before beginning to gradually climb in the 1980s. Today, the average American full time worker grinds it out for about 47 hours a week, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/09/news/economy/americans-work-bush/\" target=\"_blank\">more than any other developed country</a>. In addition, almost 40% or full-time workers are on the job 50 or more hours a week. \n\nHow did we reach this confusing state of affairs? There are a few explanations. Compared to our European counterparts, Americans chose to take midcentury gains in productivity and milk them for all they were worth, as well as sinking their earnings into larger homes and consumer goods such as cars, TVs, and fancy appliances.\n\nAt the same time, a fervently anti-communist government forced the labor movement onto the defensive. After scoring major victories in the 20s and 30s, unions focused on shoring up their gains. They lost the political support needed to push for the progressive changes that socialist-leaning European parties were able to achieve across the Atlantic. \n\nEuropean workers got a shorter day, more vacation time, and slightly more income than they had in 1950. Americans got a longer workday, paltry vacation time, and slightly more income. Real wages have barely risen since the 1970s, a result of declining unions, automation, and increasing shares of profits going to top executives. We also live in a culture that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-busyness-trap\" target=\"_blank\">fetishizes busyness</a>. Employees compete to be the last one in the office and humblebrag about how they spent all weekend on emails and how little sleep they get.\n\nEven the hard-won eight hour day feels ready for an update. Eight hours may be the perfect amount of time to work in a factory, but it seems arbitrary in the modern office. The smash success of the <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/\" target=\"_blank\">*4 Hour Workweek*</a>, rabid interest in Sweden’s <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/swedens-six-hour-workday-experiment-is-over-but-could-it-succeed-in-america-2017-01-04\" target=\"_blank\">experimental 30 hour workweek</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/10/heres-what-scientists-say-perfect-work-week/97739498/\" target=\"_blank\">new French study</a> all show that there’s growing demand for a change. Meanwhile, the gig economy lets certain types of workers clock in whenever they feel like making money, but research shows that contractors for companies like Uber often pull <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/03/uber-lyft-can-much-keep-drivers-safe/\" target=\"_blank\">dangerously long shifts</a>.\n\nParallel to the accelerating contemporary workplace, the researcher Alex S.J. Pang has been reexamining the working hours of some of history’s best known geniuses. In an <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/darwin-was-a-slacker-and-you-should-be-too\" target=\"_blank\">eye-opening article</a> for Nautilus, he looked at the daily routines of scientists like Charles Darwin and writers like Ernest Hemingway and found that an astounding number of them worked no more than four or five hours a day.\n\n All of these developments are part of a growing awareness that there’s no universal standard of hours per day that will make us truly productive. It’s probably more than two and less than ten, but beyond that we’re left to our own devices to figure it out. With the flexible nature of today’s workplace technology, employees can be given the freedom to experiment with their schedules until they strike the right balance of happy and productive. After all, that’s what Robert Owen wanted in the first place.\n\n*Illustration by Tin Nguyen*","cover":{"title":"Eight Hour Day History Feed Image","description":"Illustration by Tin Nguyen","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/1Vkz7KGUOQ2eK0iAS6UeGA/83ff16a2922f64aac2c08e39afda15b4/mbq_ah_006_8hourday_1200x800.png","details":{"size":706471,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_006_8hourday_1200x800.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"coverId":"1Vkz7KGUOQ2eK0iAS6UeGA","featuredImage":{"title":"Eight Hour Day History Feature Story","description":"Illustration by Tin Nguyen","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/6UhVmHkRKo2gso6YyagsY2/b377a70a437df10587a779f9dc5cb053/mbq_ah_006_8hourday_1422x1608__1_.png","details":{"size":553150,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_006_8hourday_1422x1608 (1).png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"6UhVmHkRKo2gso6YyagsY2","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"6IcE7HMTsIMU0aiQeEMauo","name":"Dan Katter","shortBio":"Dan Katter is a writer and editor based in Brooklyn.

Offering a visitor a few kilobytes to check the news or weather now seems like a basic act of hospitality.\n\nWorkplaces have, of course, installed wireless networks to enable internet access for the phones, tablets and laptops on which they rely. Employees who connect their personal device to a few networks a week might notice something different about their office’s wifi: often, it’s awful.\n\n“Small businesses often get hurt because they don’t have the infrastructure for wifi and they don’t know how to manage the level of traffic they’re dealing with,” says Michael Kupfer, president of <a href=\"http://blackdiamondsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Diamond Solutions</a>, a Chicago-based IT consulting firm.\n\nEmployees may wonder why it takes longer for a webpage to load or video to buffer on their phone at work than it does at home (not that they’re checking ESPN or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFzpC_e44Tg\" target=\"_blank\">watching an octopus walk on land</a> while they’re supposed to be working or anything). In addition to being a pain and making a company seem technologically unprepared, slow internet diminishes productivity. One study trying to put a dollar or percentage point on the cost of slow internet found that waiting on a sluggish computer to finalize tasks that are otherwise ready to complete <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10361881/Britons-lose-five-and-a-half-days-a-year-from-slow-computers.html\" target=\"_blank\">decreases a company’s productivity by about two percent</a>.\n\nThere are several reasons why workplace wireless networks seem to lag behind others, but the biggest, many experts agree, is that businesses do not buy business-grade wifi systems.\n\n“They take whatever [router] the internet provider hands them and they think that should work, even if that’s not really business- or enterprise-grade hardware and can’t handle a large number of devices” says Ed Wright, chief technology officer of New York City-based <a href=\"http://www.sliceitup.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Slice Wireless Solutions</a>.\n\nMany businesses owners go to consumer electronics stores and purchase routers meant for a home. They become strained once connected to all the devices that pile into even a small office. \n\nIt’s important to remember the number of devices is usually greater than the number of employees. Companies “may estimate five or ten people, but each one of those people probably brings a laptop and a cellphone,” says Kupfer. “Plus guests and customers put their phones on the wifi.” In addition, peripheral devices, like printers and speakers, are increasingly connected to computers via wifi.\n\n“The number of people in your office isn’t as important as the amount of equipment,” says Ryan Denehy, founder of <a href=\"http://www.electric.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Electric</a>, a tech support company modeled for startups and small businesses.\n\nFor a user on an overwhelmed network, loading a basic webpage becomes a ’90s flashback to hooking into a dial-up in the family den, waiting for a Buffy the Vampire Slayer message board to load.\n\nEmployers who expect dozens of devices to suck up gigabytes from their router should invest in an industrial-grade one, capable of emitting a signal that will provide a whole company the kind of performance they expect at home or at Starbucks. Cisco, Arrowhead, Hewlett-Packard, and other well-known names in the computing and communications industries make them, and models suitable for a small business range between $300 and $500.\n\nWright says to think about it in terms of the kitchen needs of a home versus those of a culinary business: “Do you need two large ovens?” he asks “The answer is yes, if you are a professional baker.”\n\nThe industrial- or enterprise-grade systems also have some unique features, such as a means to monitoring who is using the most bandwidth and cutting that device off at a certain point (so you won’t be slowed by someone torrenting “Game of Thrones” on Monday morning).\n\nIf you have the shiniest new business-class router from a major manufacturer and your wifi is still running at the speed of a rural bus station’s, there are a few advanced problems to troubleshoot.\nOne problem might be the lack of bandwidth provided by the internet service provider. Some set-ups in commercial buildings are antiquated and rely on older equipment. “It’s very old-fashioned in terms of how all this work gets done,” says Denehy. “[A provider like] Verizon has to cut a deal with the city to do construction and put a fiber-optic cable in the building.”\n\nIf a landlord hasn’t received a request for an upgrade, they may not have had incentive to get new hardware installed recently, relying instead on older, slower setups that were fine for 2003 to deliver the final mile of connection. Denehy recommends asking your provider to send out a technician to review the equipment. \nAnother potential source of trouble: Another office in the building might be an inadvertent wifi bully. Some businesses with powerful systems make a lot of wifi “noise,” says Denehy, creating overwhelming competition in the atmosphere. \n\nSmarter than starting an arms race, says Denehy, is to hire a professional to recalibrate the effectiveness of your own system in your own space. This might mean installing several access points, strategically placed around the office. Devices in the vicinity will more easily be able to establish a strong connection to your system and block out the fog created by your technologically noisy neighbor.\n\nWith workplace productivity and basic business functions increasingly dependent on reliable wireless internet access, it pays to invest in business-grade equipment and work with professionals to ensure your access is uninterrupted.

While company retreats and offsites have long been a popular strategy for team building, when organized properly, they can do much more. As shared in <a href=\"https://www.just-works.com/img/Retreats_Ora_Grodsky_and_Jeremy_Phillips.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">*The Why, When, and How of Successful Retreats*</a> from Just Works Consulting and Jeremy Phillips Consulting:\n\n“Retreats can build organizational muscle for strategic and creative thinking that can be carried back into daily work. A retreat can be an opportunity for taking stock, reflecting together, assessing and refining practice, and providing a turbo boost to specific aspects of work.” \n\nIn addition, many teams now work fully or partially remote, and so they miss out on naturally occurring opportunities for interaction and relationship building that happen when everyone works in the same physical office. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shpigford\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Pigford</a> of <a href=\"https://baremetrics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baremetrics</a> told us, “Sharing experiences with your team members is really important. If you’re dedicating years of your career to a company, you should enjoy and have strong relationships with the people you’re working with.”\n\nHe added, “Retreats give you an opportunity to get to know each other and understand personality differences without the pressure of getting a specific job done and that change in context makes a big impact.”\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/noeltock\" target=\"_blank\">Noel Tock</a> from <a href=\"https://hmn.md/\" target=\"_blank\">Human Made</a> takes relationship building a step further at company retreats.  Because the team is remote and many members are nomadic, several of them make travel plans together at retreats to co-work, and maybe even co-live, together in a different part of the world. \n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LEAHisKNOBLER\" target=\"_blank\">Leah Knobler</a> from <a href=\"https://www.helpscout.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Help Scout</a> said that their retreats increase team productivity and collaboration and she notices that when they return from a retreat, there’s a noticeable increase in activity and collaboration on the team’s chat in Slack. \n\nA successful retreat is not as simple as just holding a meeting somewhere other than the office. To help you create an experience that builds team cohesion and focus, we took cues from companies who regularly use retreats as a tool to foster innovation and broke down offsite planning into six steps. \n\n### Define and communicate the goal of your offsite\n\nSince offsites typically require company money and team time, it’s important to define and share the desired outcome for your outing with your entire team. Getting buy-in from leadership and team members requires communicating the impact the offsite activity will have on the business. \n\nWhat that impact looks like is up to you, but it should align with your business goals, values, or ideally, both. Common goals include working on specific project like launching a new feature, completing a strategic plan, building alignment with new hires or after a team reorganization, bringing geographically dispersed teams together, celebrating a milestone, or simply giving your team a break from their daily grind. \n\nYou can use offsites to focus on larger goals that may get lost in the shuffle of the day-to-day. In the <a href=\"https://baremetrics.com/blog/startup-retreat\" target=\"_blank\">lessons from their first retreat</a>, Josh Pigford of Baremetrics said, “Being in one place gave us the opportunity to brainstorm and plan out the coming months as well as hash out some bigger design, development, and marketing problems.” \n\nAlix Zacharias from <a href=\"http://aug.co/\" target=\"_blank\">August</a> (whose mission is a capable team for every meaningful mission) brings her team together three times a year for what they call “Summit.” Each Summit is used to reflect on how the business is doing, how the team works together, and to plan for the next trimester. At Summit team members get to work on parts of the business they normally wouldn’t, which results in new perspectives, new experiments, and sometimes, even changes to a part of the business. For example, the company’s core values were drafted at their first Summit. \n\nOnce you know your goal, the next step is to create a rough structure for your retreat to ensure you achieve your goal. \n\n### Have a rough schedule for your activities \n\nHow much you structure your offsite will depend on your goal, team size, and duration of the offsite. Have at least one task you want each department (or the team as a whole) to accomplish each day. Also schedule time for relevant one-on-ones, team reflections, and fun. \n\nAfter their week-long retreat, Josh from Baremetrics said, “Have a rough idea ahead of time and giving some high-level structure goes a long way. I roughly planned out each day by ‘Morning,’ ‘Afternoon’ and ‘Evening,’ but didn’t get more granular than that, especially for the ‘Morning’ section since everyone has slightly different sleeping habits.”  \n\nAlix from August said that they plan the meals and  an external activity in advance for each Summit, but get the entire team involved to help form the rest of the agenda. To use the team’s time effectively, they work together to identify and define what needs to be worked on and when. That way, they know which topics are most important to the team. \n\nLeah said Help Scout’s retreats are scheduled into four areas: visioning and goal-setting, working, team-building, and plenty of time and options for downtime and free time. They schedule structured team events such as karaoke, but also make sure the team has plenty of time to do their own thing and have time to themselves. \n\nHuman Made has a no client work rule for the week they are together, and communicate that in advance with their clients. They’re also careful to ensure that their team knows about and prepares for activities planned ahead of time, such as identifying the projects they want to work on during a hack day. They also carve out a day for each team member to give a five-minute “flash talk” that touches on a personal passion or interest with the understanding that everyone is coming to the retreat prepared so that they can be fully present, not spending offsite time preparing materials. \n\nAlthough having a plan is key, keep some flexibility. You don’t know what ideas will arise, what opportunities will present themselves, or if someone will get sick. To ensure flexibility, have a contingency plan.  \n\n### Plan your logistics out in advance \n\nHuman Made plan their retreat a year in advance. Because they often hold their retreats in far-off places, they send a small group of teammates to the retreat location location a few days in before everyone else arrives to get everything set up. Because they have over fifty people on their team, they hire two chefs to ensure meals are taken care of. In addition, they purchase all tickets for ground transportation and group activities beforehand so no one is stuck because they don’t have the right amount of coins for the local bus. \n\nMore importantly, they’re extra diligent in making sure that they have a strong wi-fi connection. Sometimes this means buying SIM cards for everyone so they can tether their phones. While your company offsite might not need quite as much advance planning, and also may not be held in a castle in Italy or a winter cabin in Norway, be sure to create a run of show for your event to ensure everything is accounted for in advance so everything can flow smoothly before, during, and after your retreat.\n\n### Consider bringing in a facilitator \n\nAlix from August says that a great facilitator can ensure you use the team’s time efficiently and effectively. More importantly, that person will make sure everyone’s voice is heard, not just the loudest person in the room and help create space for all team members to talk. \n\nIf you don’t have the capacity internally, look for an external facilitator. She suggests spending some time getting to know them (phone, video, in-person) before the offsite, to ensure their personality fits and that they’ll work well with your team. If you’re not the type of company who’s into trust falls, you don’t want someone telling you to do trust falls. \n\n### Make time for fun \n\nTo truly foster creativity, include time for non-work activities, as this is where great ideas happen or new connections are made. <a href=\"https://open.buffer.com/remote-work-retreats/\" target=\"_blank\">Courtney Seiter from Buffer</a> said, “An important element of retreats is the time we spend not working, but instead getting to know one another.”  Instead of formalized ice-breakers, the Buffer team will take part in a group activity that is special to the place they are visiting—like surfing lessons in Sydney or a volcano tour in Iceland.\n\nShe added, “In addition to pre-planned activities, there are plenty of self-organized activities—book clubs, board game nights, morning yoga, evening whiskey tasting—that anyone can spearhead or be part of, depending on their interest.” Even if you’re only taking a day, make sure there are ways for your team to take breaks and blow off steam. \n\nAlix from August said that the fun activities they build into their Summits allow team members time to get to know each other better as humans, not just coworkers, and leads to better cohesion. This enables team members to connect and find quicker solutions to work related items. \n\nWhile extracurricular activities are helpful, Leah from Help Scout suggests to not be too over-scheduled. She added, “downtime is where the special times happen. That’s where the jokes happen and memories are made.” \n\n### Keep the momentum going \n\nDuring your retreat, and just after, set the stage for continued productivity. Throughout the event ensure you are documenting the ideas, brainstorms, and solutions that come up during each session. Make sure that everyone walks away with action items to work on after the offsite. Assign a specific person, or group of people, to take ownership and follow through with specific projects. \n\nWhen your offsite is over invite your team to share what they accomplished and collect their feedback. Feedback will enable you to improve future offsites and understand what was especially effective. When your team shares their accomplishments they also demonstrate the value that an offsite adds to your company culture and initiatives and showcases what you have accomplished together. \n\n### Build togetherness\n\nOverall, offsites break down barriers that are created in companies, whether everyone works together in a single office or on a remote team. They allow space for coworkers to collaborate as their authentic selves and open up space for new ideas to emerge.\n\nReflecting on his first retreat with the company, <a href=\"https://open.buffer.com/remote-work-retreat/\" target=\"_blank\">Ross Parmly of Buffer said</a>, “I began to realize that working with the greatest team in the world doesn’t feel complete without the chance to experience real hugs, across-the-table high-fives, and in-person moments of vulnerability.” \n\nWith clear goals, careful planning, and the right balance of fun and focused work time, we hope that you will take a chance and take your team, or your whole company, offsite to experience the benefits of productivity and creativity they bring. \n\n*Photography by Nick Dunlap*\n\n\n\n","cover":{"title":"Offsite Meetings and Retreats","description":"Photo by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/2lQVYEH1u4GgWiOaGG4a0M/7f9ad877d72830a30d7efb54f60e67ef/q-offsite-h.jpg","details":{"size":1011502,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"q-offsite-h.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"2lQVYEH1u4GgWiOaGG4a0M","featuredImage":{"title":"Offsite Retreats Offsites Feature","description":"Photo by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3WHEuCX4issGcaOyCMGIGu/05d3d52115265e8b3210dd33a521b764/q-offsite-v.jpg","details":{"size":4194603,"image":{"width":2844,"height":3216}},"fileName":"q-offsite-v.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"3WHEuCX4issGcaOyCMGIGu","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"5bV0012cH62icuE4KIkKGg","name":"Shannon Byrne","shortBio":"Shannon Byrne is a freelance writer and marketer, crafting words and building communities for startups.

As companies adopt fresh approaches to culture building, from <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/meditation-mindfulness-workplace\" target=\"_blank\">mindfulness initiatives</a> to <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/aditi-ramesh-build-culture-transferwise\" target=\"_blank\">office-wide coffee dates</a>, workplaces that are dog-friendly are also on the rise. Interacting with a canine companion throughout the day promotes employee happiness and conversation, but before you let the dogs into your workspace think specifically about the needs of your colleagues and their four-legged friends.  \n\nAccording to a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Society for Human Resource Management</a> survey, roughly 8 percent of employers allow pets in the office, up from 5 percent in 2013. The uptick suggests that more and more companies are embracing the upside of having furry friends in the office, or even <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/inside-bark-and-cos-company-home-for-employees-and-dogs\" target=\"_blank\">building their workplaces with them in mind</a>.\n\n\"It brings so many benefits to both the employee and the employer,\" says Erika Kavanagh, People Operations Manager at <a href=\"https://dogvacay.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DogVacay</a>, which connects pet owners with qualified pet sitters. \"I can focus on my job more fully because I don't have to worry about going home during lunch to walk my two dogs; they're already here running around with their friends and having fun.\"\n\nIn addition to feeling like a better pet parent, Kavanagh says that the dogs prompt her to take walks, decompress and soak up more sunshine in the middle of the workday.\n\n\"If you get stressed about something, it's really hard to be angry with a dog in your lap,\" she says. \"And they break up the day. You never know what they're going to do, so there are so many cute, funny moments that happen in the office that are just a nice break for everyone to enjoy together.\"\n\nEmployee interaction is one of the biggest benefits to a dog-friendly workplace, which is echoed by team members at Nestlé's pet-friendly U.K. office. \"People will stop you in the corridors to stroke your dog so you start talking to someone in a different part of the company who you'd never normally have spoken to, or have only encountered over email,\" employee Odette Forbes told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/18/dogs-in-office-canine-colleagues-staff-wellbeing\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian's Donna Ferguson</a> in a 2016 interview.\n\nIn addition to fostering organic employee connections, open-door pet policies appear to support a whole slew of other health benefits. Experts at <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-health-benefits-and-risks-of-pet-ownership\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Medical School</a> say that our four-legged companions help reduce stress and improve heart health. They're also thought to stave off depression by encouraging physical exercise and social interactions.\n\nWhat's more, pet-friendly policies may play a very real role in employee performance and well-being. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.banfield.com/about-us/news-room/press-releases-announcements/banfield-shares-data-on-the-positive-impact-of-pet\" target=\"_blank\">Banfield Pet Hospital</a> surveyed over 1,000 employees and 200 HR decision makers across the U.S. An overwhelming majority agreed that pet-friendly offices improve things like work-life balance, morale, productivity and professional relationships. Another key finding? Over half of the employees surveyed said they'd be more likely to stay with their company if they could bring their pets into the office—a significant takeaway for recruitment and retention.\n\n\"Having a dog-friendly office helps us live our mission; we want to make the world better for pets and those who love them. This, in turn, helps us recruit and retain passionate employees who share in this mission,\" says Kavanagh. \"On a broader scale, a dog-friendly office is a great tool for any company looking to add an amazing benefit to their culture.\" \nBut running a pet-friendly office doesn't come without challenges; allergies and sanitation issues immediately come to mind. Being a pet-servicing industry, DogVacay has an obvious leg up. (Kavanagh says that pretty much all their employees are dog lovers.) However, those of us who aren't pet people might not be too keen on sharing our workspace with playful pups.\n\n\"About 10 years ago, I worked for a small startup that had an open-door policy for dogs and I wasn't a fan,\" says Ryan Buynak, a creative strategist in South Florida. \"I'm a dog lover at heart, but found it difficult to concentrate with the CEO's high-energy Yorkie zipping around the office and barking nonstop—not to mention the accidents he frequently left by desk!\"\n\nBuynak's concerns are valid, but it seems that more and more companies are taking steps to get ahead of potential problems. As The Guardian reports, Nestlé's U.K. office has strict no-dog zones to accommodate visitors who prefer to do business pet-free. They also have a comprehensive vetting system that requires every dog to pass a three-month trial period before becoming an official team member.\n\nAll of this begs an obvious question: What about employees with allergies? It's probably in the company's best interest to create a separate pet-free work area for exactly this reason. It's actually more of a legal safeguard than a courtesy. As <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/dog-friendly-office-beware.html\" target=\"_blank\">Inc.'s Christine Lagorio-Chafkin reported</a> in 2016, an animal allergy could potentially be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Failing to make reasonable accommodations could find employers in hot water, legally speaking. Property damage and personal injury represent other possible pitfalls. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is if your current office space allows pets. In 2015, a number of executives from dog-friendly companies told <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/15/more-firms-allowing-dogs-and-other-pets-in-the-office.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a> that finding this kind of commercial real estate is a real hurdle in some cities.\n\nAt the end of the day, the decision to go all in with pets in the workplace really comes down to the employer. June 23 is annual Take Your Dog to Work Day, which could be a great way to test the waters. If all goes well, you might have a wildly popular employee wellness add-on at your fingertips.\n\n*Photography by Nick Dunlap, with special thanks to Brandy and Lexy.*\n","cover":{"title":"q-dogs-h-small","description":"Melanie and Brandy by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/1Ll5eMtvtKcsqoWeueOi6m/f222d5c91344876978d50510863d5f2f/q-dogs-h-small.jpg","details":{"size":704409,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"q-dogs-h-small.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"1Ll5eMtvtKcsqoWeueOi6m","featuredImage":{"title":"q-dogs-v","description":"Christian and Lexy by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3dC8WErWmcq0guawSkwoKK/92951d1fbb1cdfadde5d8cc4adbed0bb/q-dogs-v.jpg","details":{"size":4193193,"image":{"width":2844,"height":3216}},"fileName":"q-dogs-v.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"3dC8WErWmcq0guawSkwoKK","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"2NTHSZfR0QYaMyIC2Gec0q","name":"Marianne Hayes","shortBio":"Marianne Hayes is a longtime writer, storyteller and devoted bookworm.

Complimentary gourmet meals have long been a hallmark of tech giants like <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidburkus/2015/07/02/the-real-reason-google-serves-all-that-free-food/#226a7bd895f6\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-campus-cafeterias-2014-3\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bonappetweet\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.  While companies with more modest budgets can’t compete with <a href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/food/Eric-Dela-Cruz-My-Life-Google-Chef-1533586\" target=\"_blank\">sushi Thursdays and daily pizza stations</a> as an employee perk, businesses across a wide spectrum of industries now offer high-quality snacks to keep their employees happy and productive throughout the day.  \n\nFood isn’t just a feel-good perk — it has a measurable impact on employee satisfaction. In a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3035005/the-future-of-work/does-incentivizing-employees-with-free-food-actually-work\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>\n financed by the staffing agency Spherion, 30 percent of employees surveyed said that availability of food throughout the day contributes to their workplace happiness. Peapod, the grocery delivery service, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/09/16/study-says-snacks-affect-happiness-at-work/72259746/\" target=\"_blank\">conducted a survey</a> where half of respondents said they’d consider perks like free food when looking for a new job, while 67 percent of full-time employees who snack on the company dime are either “extremely” or “very” happy with their current job. Snacks are not everything, however. While millennial workers were more likely to say they wished their office offered more snack options, workers in their age bracket were <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/millennials-free-food-at-work-but-no-health-care/\" target=\"_blank\">more likely to get free snacks and meals at work than health insurance</a>. \n\nSnacking at work can also lead to poor nutritional choices, as can be attested by anyone who has sworn they are only going to have one Girl Scout cookie. Constantly consuming processed foods, vending machine junk food, and even convenience snacks touting a “healthy” label are enough to undo even the most thoughtful workplace wellness plan. \n\nDon’t despair yet, office snack lovers. “Snacking is a healthy way to meet our needs and not eat three huge meals in a day,” said Dr. Janice Blythe, PhD, RD, a nutritionist and professor of Child & Family Studies at Berea College, but between-meal noshing should be “aligned with a person’s needs for the whole day.”\n\nHow can employers help keep their team healthy and satisfied when it comes to snacking? Dietitians shared these six guidelines to keep in mind when stocking the office pantry.\n\n### Think Whole Foods\n\nA concept distinct from the grocery chain of the same name, lower-case <a href=\"http://gethealthygethot.com/61.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">whole foods</a> are ones that have undergone little modification before reaching your mouth. Think entire apples or raw nuts as opposed to protein bars or chips.  \nThis idea can be a <a href=\"http://www.snacknation.com/blog/guide/healthy-snacks/\" target=\"_blank\">key to healthy snacking</a>, said Judy Simon, RDN, CD, an instructor at the University of Washington and a clinical dietitian at the school’s medical center. “Keep it simple,” she said. “Raw fruits and nuts, or a bar with fruits and nuts, and maybe a little cinnamon.” Yogurt, cheese, seeds and whole-grain crackers or pretzels are also relatively simple snacks to keep around the office. Popcorn is also okay, said Simon, but look for varieties with no butter, salt or seasoning added.  \n\nThe simplicity factor makes for an easier, more accurate measure, especially because some food companies slap labels on their packages to imply nutritional benefit. “Non-GMO, organic or low-fat doesn’t mean it’s healthy,” said Simon. “Dried kale chips are really, really salty.”\n\n### Individually wrapped servings are your ally \n\nPortions are important when snacking. “A snack means 100 to 200 calories,” said Dr. Amy Mobley, PhD, RD, an assistant professor in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Connecticut. “Go above that and it looks like a meal.” \n\nWhile few people know off-hand the calorie count of a banana—or the amount of peanuts that fill the palm of a hand—many groceries offer seeds, nuts, fruit cups and other healthy nibbling options in prepackaged snack serving sizes, ideal for a 3 p.m. pick-me-up.  \n\n### Invest in a decent-sized refrigerator\n\nRefrigeration greatly expands a workplace’s healthy snack options. It opens up the possibility of cheese slices, yogurt and—most importantly—vegetables, like carrots and cauliflower florets, with dips.\n\n“Fresh vegetables are very low in calories and provide a lot of vitamins and minerals,” said Blythe. A small tray with chilled vegetables with cheese could make for a filling snack, high enough in fiber to keep a worker going until 5, she said.\n\nMobley recommended keeping hummus on hand as a dip for carrots and other veggies. \n\n### Remember sanitation \n\nTurning your workspace into a sorta-cafeteria carries some health and safety concerns. Blythe said that any space where food is kept should have a sink with hand sanitizer. Keeping specially made veggie washes on hand to clean fruit and vegetables is also a good idea and will help make those options more attractive to snack-seekers.\n\n### Avoid mindless eating cues\n\nMobley said that at her last office job, she frequently took sweets from the candy bowl, despite knowing better as a nutritionist. “It’s an instant stress-reliever and you stop thinking about it if it’s always there and everyone’s doing it,” she said.\n\nSources of junk food and empty-calorie items, like candy dishes and vending machines, are particularly tempting on the job, where work takes over people’s focus and willpower can be lost in the bustle. Even the most health-minded employees often eat such items as a reward for completing a task or to deal with workplace stress. To cut down on mindless grazing on sweets Mobley recommended removing from the office snack repertoire and to reserve them for special occasions so that cookie or cake truly feels like a reward.\n\n### Don’t forget about beverage choice \n\nEncouraging healthy consumption habits should extend to drinks. “A lot of calories come from beverages,” said Blythe, citing an oft-forgotten fact. \n\nIf an employer is going to fill a fridge with drinks, she recommended fruit juice with no additives, lemonade, and limeade, in addition to a supply of purified water. As for sweeteners for your coffee, make sure to pick up stevia—it has fewer calories than sugar.

In the northern half of the country, it’s the time of year when good weather finally arrives, takes off its jacket, and stays awhile. Like hungry bears emerging from their caves, bikes across America roll out of garages and basements, ready to hit the road. A beautiful day can be just the nudge we need to put down our bus passes and car keys and strap on a helmet.\n\nOf course, not everyone is so inclined. There are a million excuses to leave that bike at home. There’s nowhere to park it near the office. I don’t want to be sweaty when I get there. I like to listen to podcasts and zone out on the subway. Despite the fact that biking to work makes commuters <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/1795631/study-bike-commuters-are-happiest\" target=\"_blank\">feel happier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1678986/this-bike-could-save-your-life-an-infographic-on-the-massive-benefits-of-bicycling\" target=\"_blank\">lose weight</a>, and <a href=\"http://road.cc/content/news/130251-walking-or-cycling-work-means-less-stress-and-more-productivity-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\">get more work done</a>, few Americans <a href=\"http://bikeleague.org/commutingdata\" target=\"_blank\">actually do it</a>.\n\nA bike-friendly workplace can tip the scales for the reluctant cyclists among us. It shuts down some of those excuses, but it also signals that biking is a normal way to get to the office. It can be a big encouragement to know that one’s company is committed to making the bike commute a reality. Here are some things to keep in mind as you shift gears into a cyclical state of mind.\n\n### Find your space\nProviding a safe place for bikes is absolutely essential. Nobody wants to spend the workday worrying if their bike will still be there when they leave. If you can find the space for it, a bike room with a lockable door is the gold standard of bike parking. <a href=\"https://www.managedbyq.com/services#category-2\" target=\"_blank\">Installing wall racks</a> can help you fit more bikes into a small space. If your office is on an upper floor, check with your building manager to make sure it’s okay if employees bring bikes in the elevator and that there’s a clear path from the street to the bike room. \n\nIf setting aside a room just for cycle storage is out of the question, then it’s time to embrace the outdoor bike rack. Install one at the entrance to your company parking lot or garage, or reach out to your city’s department of transportation to have them drop a rack on the sidewalk in front of your building. Due to high demand, many cities have set up specific online forms to request new bike racks. Take advantage! \n\n### Hit the showers\nMost bike commuters tend to work up a bit of a sweat on their way in, so providing an office shower is a major show of support. Look into adding a shower stall and changing area to one of your existing bathrooms. If the cost involved is out of the question, try setting up a group membership with a local gym so your employees have somewhere to freshen up. When summer rolls around, this will feel like a godsend.\n\n### Pile on the benefits\nBikeshare programs in New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, and several other cities offer corporate membership packages. With an annual or monthly subscription, your company can offer employees unlimited bikeshare memberships at steeply discounted rates. \n\nIn addition, all employers are eligible to give bicycling commuters a $20 reimbursement per month for the expenses incurred while biking. Employees only need to bike three times a week to qualify. It’s a win-win arrangement– your company can deduct the reimbursement from its payroll taxes.\n\n### Get the gear\nKeep some basic tools on hand for workday repairs and maintenance. There’s no need to set up a full-service bike shop behind the reception desk, but a few essentials will get you a long way. For about $40, you can get an air pump, a spare tire, a tire patch kit, and a multi-tool. With a bit of knowledge you can easily find online, these simple items can address 90% of everyday bike issues. Plus, riders will feel more secure knowing that if they have a mechanical snag on the way in, they’ll be able to fix it and bike home the same day.\n\n### Grow the community \nNo one wants to feel like they’re the only one biking to work. To foster a group mentality among riders, set up a bulletin board, email list, or Slack channel where they can compare notes and share tips. Bring in a guest speaker to talk about topics like bike safety or campaigns to increase bike lanes in your area. Take advantage of National Bike-to-Work Month to hold an event, with plenty of free food and giveaways. The League of American Bicyclists has a <a href=\"http://bikeleague.org/BikeMonthGuide\" target=\"_blank\">terrific Bike Month Guide</a> on how to plan an event for your company, with fun ideas like a car vs. bus vs. bike race and a breakfast rally. You can also join up with a city-wide or neighborhood-wide mass ride, such as those offered by <a href=\"https://biketours.transalt.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Transportation Alternatives</a> in New York City. Like most things, biking is even more fun when you do it with other people. \n\n","cover":{"title":"Bike to work feed image","description":"Bike to work by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3fmrb83KP6Y4wwwU4YkMwe/c1371ea0cd15bb1e479af1d6f0424b66/q-bike-h__1_.jpg","details":{"size":943575,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"q-bike-h (1).jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"3fmrb83KP6Y4wwwU4YkMwe","featuredImage":{"title":"Bike to work story photo","description":"Bike to work by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/7H1JFeaIbCGUQ8sWemkeAk/c31f723dea38e83d04ad23277feab9ee/q-bike-v__1_.jpg","details":{"size":1048877,"image":{"width":2844,"height":3216}},"fileName":"q-bike-v (1).jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"7H1JFeaIbCGUQ8sWemkeAk","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"6IcE7HMTsIMU0aiQeEMauo","name":"Dan Katter","shortBio":"Dan Katter is a writer and editor based in Brooklyn.

","body":"In the northern hemisphere, August has long been known for bringing on the “<a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/150710-dog-days-summer-sirius-star-astronomy-weather-language/\" target=\"_blank\">dog days of summer</a>,” and summer 2017 is <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/weather/news/august-temperature-outlook-2017-update\" target=\"_blank\">on track</a> to be among the hottest ever. As a result, air conditioner use has also be on the rise, bringing in-office temperatures to some of the lowest of the year—and for many, that means spending weeks in a workplace that’s several degrees below comfort level.\n\nMore often than not, women are the ones bundling up at their desks through summertime, though employees of all genders have reported feeling the chill. Experts say this phenomenon can be traced to a decades-old algorithm for indoor climates that centers around a certain kind of worker: a 40-year-old man with a fairly lean build. \n\nAccording to a widely shared <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n12/full/nclimate2741.html?foxtrotcallback=true\" target=\"_blank\">2015 study</a>, this algorithm dates back to the 1960s, and factors in several variables to reach an ideal temperature for the perceived average worker. Researchers found that one of the primary variables in this “empirical thermal comfort model,” which has reportedly controlled most offices’ AC systems ever since, involves the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/principles-of-physiology/metabolism-and-thermoregulation/a/metabolic-rate\" target=\"_blank\">basal metabolic rate</a> (BMR) of the ‘average’ worker. This defines how quickly a person expends energy while at rest, thereby creating a level of body heat that requires neither sweating nor shivering to maintain. \n\nBecause people on the female gender spectrum typically have lower BMRs than male-spectrum folks do, one of the primary variables in this AC algorithm may leave women out in the cold from the start. According to the researchers, such formulas could even overestimate the average female metabolic rate by up to 35%—meaning women would typically have to expend well more energy, pile on heat-retaining layers, or both, to keep their bodies at the right temperature at work.\n\n“For an accurate vision of thermal demand, you need an accurate vision of metabolic rates,” explained study author Boris Kingma, a biophysicist at the Netherlands’ Maastricht University, to <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-thermostat-may-be-sexist1/\" target=\"_blank\">Scientific American</a>. “If your building is 50 percent male and 50 percent female, you’re already over your estimated cooling demand.”\n\nThis kind of cooling behavior doesn’t just demand more energy from certain workers (whether it’s the calories needed to shiver or to haul extra sweaters around). Overcooling is also a major contributor to the carbon footprint of buildings, according to Kingma’s team, draining money and resources along the way. \n\nAnd despite efficiency upgrades to these systems, their success is often “undermined,” as *Scientific American* put it, by occupants who seek to adjust for personal comfort with space heaters in the summer or open windows in winter. “People will adapt their behavior until they are comfortable,” Kingma told the site.\n\nAs such, the study proposes “[using] actual metabolic rates” in future cooling algorithms, which may require some bodily self-reporting by office workers. More specifically tailored temperatures could help occupants be more comfortable in shared buildings, according to Kingma’s team, and meaningfully bring down the carbon cost of such buildings, which account for <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=86&t=1/\" target=\"_blank\">almost half</a> of U.S. energy use.\n\nMore occupant-specific ACs could help ensure that both statistical outliers and those who fall in the midst of the spectrum are accounted for too—something that interests men just as much as women. In response to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/chilly-at-work-a-decades-old-formula-may-be-to-blame.html\" target=\"_blank\">its coverage</a> of Kingma’s study, for example, the New York Times received a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/science/blame-a-male-biased-algorithm-for-the-temperature-in-your-office-readers-respond.html\" target=\"_blank\">flood of responses</a> from women who cheered the new assessment, but also from men who still find themselves sweating in peak AC season.\n\nMen tend to be most comfortable in rooms of around 71 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Kingma, so the 77 degrees preferred by women can be uncomfortably hot. Taking off your jacket can only do so much, Times readers pointed out (in so many words), and while women have some cooler options for summer wear, many offices still require long pants and button up shirts from men. \n\nSome readers suggested that if office temperatures are going to rise along with outside ones (and if we’d like to deccelerate the latter), then office culture needs to evolve with the climes. That could mean showing more consideration in how we share these climate-controlled spaces, and rethinking how a group’s values are reflected by the environment they’ve created to work in.\n\nIf employee comfort and productivity are more important to a firm than decorum, for example, that firm could consider allowing all employees to wear (reasonable) shorts, and short sleeves. As it turns out, temperature actually plays a big part in how people perform, making it a valuable area for employers’ attention.  \n\nAs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20160617-the-never-ending-battle-over-the-best-office-temperature\" target=\"_blank\">BBC News</a> explained last year, research has shown that warmer or colder settings can affect our success with different tasks, though most studies to date have been small. In one study, nine women who worked in an insurance office were able to type nonstop with an error rate of just 10% when the room temperature was 77 degrees, but became half as productive, with twice as many errors, when the temperature fell to 68. In another study, students who were asked to pick the most cost-effective phone plans performed better in a 66 degree room than in a 77-degree room, “suggesting complex decisions are more difficult when we’re warm.”\n\nAt the same time, as noted by BBC News, warmer environments tend to be conducive to creative and collaborative behavior, while cool environments seem to help people keep their mind (or at least their focus) on repetitive tasks for longer. Overall, some experts think that somewhere between 71 and 75 degrees lies the ideal temperature for office-type work that involves mental but not much physical exertion; on the other hand, some might find that simply too hot, or too cold. \n\nRecommendations for shared workplace temperatures vary, and few <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/workplacetemperature.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">organizations</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/phys_agents/thermal_comfort.html\" target=\"_blank\">governments</a> seem anxious to put those numbers on the books. In the near future, today’s smart thermostats may evolve into customizable, personal climate zones, making the search for an all-inclusive algorithm effectively moot.\n\nIn the meantime, scientists have some ideas that might help you handle those last few degrees between your ideal temperature and the office reality. The BBC cited a small study which showed that subjects who spent time in a cool room felt “significantly warmer” if the room was lit with sunset-like ‘warm’ lighting rather than ‘cool’ tones, suggesting one option for workers to gently trick themselves into greater comfort. According to research, simply holding hot or cold drinks is an effective way to adjust mind and body temperatures, too. \n\nKingma pointed out that spending time in a range of temperatures can also be good for our overall health, even if modern life doesn’t always permit. “By exposing yourself to mild cold and mild warm environments you get both cardiovascular and metabolic exercise,” he told BBC News in 2016.\n\nWhether you choose to use lighting mind tricks in the office or simply wait out the personalized climate revolution, there’s hope that if you’re totally freezing or sweltering alongside your comfortable peers, science has determined it’s not in your head.\n\n*Illustration by Tin Nguyen*\n","cover":{"title":"ColdOffice 1200x800","description":"Illustration by Tin Nguyen","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/445Ty7t2RaCUiuyImMKuUg/cf24f41e1911271f2b413a706896f636/mbq_ah_009_ColdOffice_1200x800.png","details":{"size":1617154,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_009_ColdOffice_1200x800.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"coverId":"445Ty7t2RaCUiuyImMKuUg","featuredImage":{"title":"ColdOffice 1422x1608","description":"Illustration by Tin Nguyen","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/1jsUl5foCAus86SwGw6SYo/746d7e174a280d530b13b837a044086e/mbq_ah_009_ColdOffice_1422x1608.png","details":{"size":731215,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_009_ColdOffice_1422x1608.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"1jsUl5foCAus86SwGw6SYo","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"3F7RaR6BMAKCEMGImyWqoQ","name":"Janet Burns","shortBio":"Janet is a freelance writer living in Brooklyn, NY, and can be found via warmlyjanetburns.com.","headshotId":"320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ","headshotImage":{"title":"Janet Burns author photo","description":"Janet Burns author photo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ/461a2f17b03ecc8818a0e627efb3a601/park_headshot.jpg","details":{"size":544905,"image":{"width":1364,"height":1364}},"fileName":"park headshot.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"slideshowImages":[]},{"id":"10Zu8mtqXm0QUWaCOEIUw8","slug":"structuring-a-recruiting-process-sidewalk-labs-jan-fiegel","publicationDate":"2017-09-27T00:00-04:00","modifiedDate":"2017-09-27T14:38:37.051Z","type":"Feature","title":"Structuring a Recruiting Process: Insights from Sidewalk Labs’ Jan Fiegel","subtitle":"The Alphabet Company’s Head of Talent offers advice for setting up an effective recruiting and interview process.","body":"“Recruiting is about helping companies make hiring decisions with confidence and based on facts, not biases,” Jan Fiegel says. “Especially in fast-changing startups, structure matters.”\n\nIt may sound simple, but Jan believes that creating structure is a vital component of recruiting. Currently the Head of Talent at <a href=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sidewalk Labs</a>, he speaks from over seven years of recruiting experience that spans three different countries. \n\nA German native who studied in Switzerland, Jan found himself in Berlin in 2009, having just graduated at the height of the global recession with a degree in International Affairs. The jobs he’d envisioned for himself were nowhere to be found. Then he saw an ad of a company seeking a “Manager Of Tomorrow.”\n\n“I said, ‘Great! Sign me up!’” Jan laughs. He didn’t quite know what he was getting into, but he needed a job. The interviews led to a job offer with a recruiting agency, where he began his career. After two years, he moved to his first startup, a mobile gaming company.\n\nIt would be the first of four tech startups he would join over the next four years; he would also move with his wife from Berlin to the UK and finally to New York in 2014. In New York he joined Oscar, the health insurance startup, to grow them from 100 to over 500 employees in less than two years. In September of 2016 he started at Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet company focused on making cities better through technology, and built the recruiting function and a small team. \n\nAt quickly growing startups, recruiting functions are often cobbled-together, making it challenging to make the necessary hires and thoughtfully grow a team. The upside is there is ample opportunity to learn about recruiting. In smaller companies without a full-time recruiting function, those in office and people management are often tasked with certain recruiting responsibilities. \n\nFor those new to the practice of recruiting, Jan offered guidance for building the right foundation. While he doesn’t believe there is one way of doing things that fits all companies or individuals, his insights can provide guidance to anyone interested in pursuing a career in recruiting or in improving the recruiting process at their company.  \n\n### It’s a process, treat it like one \n\n“Recruiting is, in many ways, an operations function. There’s a very clear set of stages that candidates and companies move through,” said Jan. “It’s a process, so treat it like one. Get the [software] systems to support your work.” \n\nEvery day, Jan’s calendar is packed full of meetings with team members, networking calls, phone interviews, rejection calls, email time, in-person interviews, and metrics reviews. Reviewing his schedule, it becomes clear that being a recruiter is not all about flashy searches for executive candidates or the power trip of constantly determining the fate of interview hopefuls. A large component of the work is administrative steps that take a lot of time, but need to be done correctly to move forward. \n\nJan insists that an applicant tracking system is essential to managing his time and decreasing the energy he spends on churn activities. It eliminates a lot of unnecessary emailing and time making spreadsheets. He also recommends having an email productivity suite to more efficiently reach out to multiple candidates and schedule or confirm interviews, among other features. \n\nEven if certain software and applications make the work easier, ultimately, you still need to have strong organizational skills and the ability to multitask. Still, Jan advises that anyone asked to to juggle multiple responsibilities and roles clearly communicate their workload and what they can manage well, or where corners have to be cut or timeframes re-evaluated.\n\n### Recruiting is a people business, so be human \n\nBy nature, there is an emotional imbalance in recruiting: for candidates, the process is typically more personal, because they open themselves up to evaluation. Jan stresses that it’s important to realize this and remember that efforts to communicate clearly and get back to candidates promptly can go a long way. \n\nAs with most jobs, you’ll have to do things that are uncomfortable. He emphasizes that it will be nerve-wracking to make your first rejection call informing a person they didn’t get the job, but the subsequent rejection calls will get easier. To grow as a recruiter, it’s important to embrace trial and error. Remember: even if you fumble a phone interview, or don’t set things up for an on-site interview in exactly the right way, strong candidates, more often than not, will still come through. \n\n“I think the great thing about getting into recruiting is that most of the time it’s not a very high-risk endeavor. There’s room to experiment, as long as others realize you genuinely care. Stakes become higher once you get to the offer stage,” he says. “Yet again, if you’ve done your job well in terms of treating it as a human endeavor, you should have the personal connection and the knowledge to navigate this step successfully, too.” \n\n### Act thoughtfully and structure your interview process \n\nWhen it comes to the interview itself, Jan is a strong advocate of structured interviewing to create a consistent experience for all candidates. Almost everyone has experienced an unstructured interview, where interviewers come in unprepared and ask generic questions as they scan a candidate’s resume. Typically, those interviews are conversational, with no discernable focus, linger on the candidate’s experiences, and end up with repetitive questions for the interviewee. This approach has been shown to lead to inaccurate evaluation, as “go with the flow” conversation undermines proper evaluation and allows biases to run rampant.\n\nStructured interview processes, on the other hand, build on a clear articulation of the evaluation criteria. The process consistently assigns specific criteria and interview questions to different interviewers. For example, one interviewer might ask about a candidate's work and communication style, while another might ask about their experience with data analysis. Of course, each structured interview process must be tailored to suit the culture of the company and the needs of the role and hiring manager. Working within a predetermined structure drives greater objectivity, allows interviewers to get a sense for what “good” sounds like [across multiple candidates], and ensures that all candidates are asked the same types of questions, repeatedly assessing for the same qualities and skills.\n\nIf you want to implement a structured interview process, these are Jan’s steps: \n- Define what success looks like for the role\n- Identify the drivers of that success\n- Choose the appropriate assessment method and interviewers\n- Brief your interviewers\n- Debrief and discuss feedback after the interview\n\nFollowing these steps will help you make better hires more confidently, and will likely help you create a more diverse workplace: evaluating all candidates using the same, consistent standards is a key step towards eliminating bias.\n\n### Stay open to learning and serendipity\n\nFor people new to recruiting, there is a lot of reading and content out there to learn about the profession. Recruiting is a relatively young field that has absorbed practices from other fields, such as marketing, human resources, and sales. Jan encourages looking for inspiration from these fields and applying aspects of each in a meaningful way. \n\nIn recruiting, as in life, there should also be room for serendipity within the structure. Even though Jan describes his own mind as “German, structured, [obsessed with] process and engineering,” there is one major part of his life that he came upon by pure chance. Eleven-and-a-half years ago he was traveling in Guatemala and ended up on a bus where he met the American woman who is now his wife.

The space impacts employee morale and productivity, and can make a significant impression on visitors, including potential partners or investors. In addition, renovations disrupt employees’ workflows and are known for running over timelines and budget.\n\nThese are just a few of the factors Tim Cynova and Nicola Carpenter, the Chief Operating Officer and Administrative Associate at <a href=\"https://www.fracturedatlas.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fractured Atlas</a>, took into account when they embarked on an office redesign in 2016. Fractured Atlas is a nonprofit organization with a mission to provide artists and arts organizations with access to funding, insurance, education, and the tools they need to manage the business function of their work. Since 2010, they have occupied an entire floor of an office building in midtown Manhattan, which they inherited complete with 1990’s-style furniture and cubicles from the previous tenant. \n\nWhen they moved in, Fractured Atlas had 10 people, but by early 2016, they had grown substantially to 35 staff members and space was running out. They could have taken the easy route and simply added more desks, but Fractured Atlas chose to take the path of making a more dynamic improvement. Just as they support their artist members in embracing innovation, Cynova and Carpenter decided to take a similar approach to their own organization and design a better work environment for their staff.\n\n### Start with research\n\nCynova and Carpenter knew that the office’s outdated decor and color palette had to go, but they understood that choosing colors and furniture were not the most important design decisions they had to make. Most crucial was understanding how the space would impact the people working there. They wanted to learn how the Fractured Atlas team worked best, and then implement those findings in their redesign. \n\nThey dove into research, held focus groups with current employees, hired an architect who was as interested in creating people-centered spaces as she was in aesthetics, and visited other companies like Zappos, Kickstarter, Yahoo, and The Motley Fool to gain outside perspectives on which workspace elements worked and which didn’t. \n\n### Rethink the dedicated desk\n\nWhile the Fractured Atlas team had grown considerably, nearly a third of the thirty-five worked remotely full-time, while another half worked remotely one or two days a week, and only a small percentage, like Cynova and Carpenter, were in the office five days a week. \n\nIn the old office setup, every employee had a dedicated desk, even though some were only in the office several times a week. Cynova and Carpenter noticed that on any given day one-quarter to one-half of all the desks in the company were empty. As part of the redesign they shifted from assigned desks to unassigned desks and allow team members to decide where they sit every day. Employees who are in the office five days a week still have the option to have a dedicated desk, but everyone else picks up their laptops from an assigned locked drawer when they arrive and then sits at a vacant desk in an open work space they call “The Meadow.”\n\nWhile open office plans are the status quo for most tech startups, they have come under criticism for not allowing workers enough quiet or privacy. When they set up “The Meadow,” Cynova and Carpenter took this into account and installed semi-opaque side partitions that give each employee some privacy from their next-door desk neighbors. When visiting other offices, Cynova also noticed that most people used their monitors as physical dividers, not screens. For added workspace privacy each desk is also equipped with double monitors. \n\n### Create comfortable, flexible spaces\n\nAfter analyzing the responses from focus groups and observing how staff members used the office space, Cynova and Carpenter created flexible work spaces that employees could utilize when they needed a change from “The Meadow.” They designed a quiet room with two standing desks after observing that team members were making rickety standing desks out of towers of books. They also created smaller rooms that could be booked via Google Calendar for private calls or to conduct webinars, which the Fractured Atlas staff host frequently for their artist members. Finally, they added a cozy library with a color-coded book collection, plants, and comfortable chairs. The colors and furniture in each space were carefully selected to represent the organization’s personality and to match the Fractured Atlas logo.\n\nOther elements of the redesign included installing a door to separate the kitchen from the rest of the space, converting the CEO’s office into an additional conference room, and the creation of a mother’s room for moms who need to pump while they are at work. \n\n### Embrace art and creativity\n\nAs an organization that supports artists, it was also important for the office to feature art created by some of Fractured Atlas’ 63,000 artist members. When visitors first step off the elevator they are greeted by a mural commissioned from The Baltimore Love Project painted over the reception desk. There are also sculptures from artists around the space, including a growing collection of smaller works in the library. \n\n“You want to work someplace that looks inspiring. It also reminds us that we work for our members,” Cynova said of the artwork. “Empowering artists by eliminating practical barriers to creative expression is what we do, that’s why we exist. Having those reminders around our office makes it a more meaningful place.”   \n\n### Create opportunity from constraints\n\nAnyone tackling an office redesign will face budgetary limitations, and Fractured Atlas, as a non-profit, was no exception. Once again, the staff’s background in the arts shaped their DIY attitude and fueled their resourcefulness. They embraced the mindset that constraints make you more creative and made use of staff members’ unique talents to enhance the space. Carpenter, who sews her own clothes, used her fiber arts background to make sound panels for a conference room. \n\nWhile the amount of skills that are required when undertaking an office redesign might seem daunting, office managers should embrace the opportunity. They can consider it a chance to learn about their own strengths and preferences, especially if they are in the early stages of their careers. \n\n“I’m at a place in my career where I’m still considering what I’m going to do with the rest of my life,” said Carpenter. “To have this big of a project and be able to be so involved was really amazing. I learned so much about the things I like to do and the things I don’t like to do. I can use that knowledge to shape where I want to go in the future.” \n\n### Manage change\n\nEveryone responds to change differently, so Cynova and Carpenter made sure to communicate every step of the redesign process to their team and worked to accommodate their concerns. During the most intense three weeks of the office renovation, no one could work in the space. Some staff members were concerned about not being able to productively work from home for such a long period of time, so Fractured Atlas rented a few desks in a co-working space for use during construction. Carpenter also created a booklet that she shared with her colleagues before the renovation. It outlined what they could expect in the redesigned office and how the new spaces could be used.  \n\nAfter the bulk of renovations were done, Cynova asked that staff members settle into the space and wait three months before making any major requests or giving feedback. After three months, he sent around a survey asking how people were using the new space and what they would still change. Many spoke positively of the redesign, saying they felt more connected to each other in the new space. \n\nAs the Fractured Atlas team settles into the redesigned space Cynova and Carpenter continue to make small changes to ensure it continues to serve their team and reflect their evolving company culture. “Part of the core of Fractured Atlas’ DNA is constant iteration and change,” said Cynova. “It permeates everything.” Much like the ambitious artists they represent, the staff never considers their work fully complete. \n\nThinking of an office redesign? <a href=\"http://managedbyq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Managed by Q</a> can help you with office design and build out, painting, and furniture assembly, as well as keeping your new space neat, clean and productive day-to-day.\n\n*Photography by Dominick Mastrangelo*\n","cover":{"title":"FracturedAtlas Sharpened Feed ","description":"Nicola Carpenter and Tim Cynova","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/6I3uN0eImIUcAikIQMiIU8/b11610beb879dfbad39af0653c9b6683/FracturedAtlas_Sharpened.png","details":{"size":6565283,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"FracturedAtlas_Sharpened.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"coverId":"6I3uN0eImIUcAikIQMiIU8","featuredImage":{"title":"FracturedAtlas 1422 Sharpened","description":"Nicola Carpenter and Tim Cynova ","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3hNuAo9zBmA2qc0kaKYQeW/0f841c5450d712b8be486d323329fa5e/FracturedAtlas_1422_Sharpened.png","details":{"size":8378602,"image":{"width":2490,"height":2816}},"fileName":"FracturedAtlas_1422_Sharpened.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"3hNuAo9zBmA2qc0kaKYQeW","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"5oWCdeqppKoo2SAA6oKEqg","name":"Kristen Felicetti","shortBio":"Kristen Felicetti is a Brooklyn-based writer.

Depending who’s behind it, the purpose, methods, and effectiveness of everyday surveillance can vary widely, as well as the rules for doing so; in most places, such privacy laws are just starting to evolve. \n\nThanks to the spread of ever-more sophisticated and affordable options surveillance and data collection in the workplace has grown up along with the technology. Yesterday’s time clocks, magnetic-style swipe cards, and security cameras, which registered our comings and goings for anyone who bothered to check, have become today’s <a href=\"http://www.vocativ.com/414570/workplace-spying-surveillance-dystopia-we-work-in/\" target=\"_blank\">fingerprint-scanners</a> and location-tracking <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-14/new-office-sensors-know-when-you-leave-your-desk\" target=\"_blank\">software or sensors</a>; annual physicals and questionnaires have evolved into a constant stream of health data collected by <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-wearables-wellness-programs-1113-biz-20161111-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">employer-sponsored health trackers</a>. \n\nWhen it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/corporate-surveillance-activists/406201/\" target=\"_blank\">private employers</a>, most are free to keep an electronic eye trained on employees and their activities, so long as it’s on the clock; in some cases, companies have even been allowed to digitally <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/worker-fired-for-disabling-gps-app-that-tracked-her-24-hours-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\">follow them home</a>. And while it’s no secret that most employers are monitoring their workers on the job, many aren’t aware of just how their day is being tracked, nor what they or their employer might hope to gain—or stand to lose. \n\nProponents of employee monitoring argue that it enables greater productivity, security, and even harmony at the workplace than we’ve been used to. For jobs involving sales or a high level of customer service, software that tracks employee performance and interactions has increasingly been used as a supervisory and <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/297215\" target=\"_blank\">training tool</a>, helping to identify or automatically refer opportunities for further service, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/10/in-praise-of-electronically-monitoring-employees\" target=\"_blank\">prevent theft</a>, or make note of when a job’s done well.\n\nAccording to the creators and users of such software, that sort of data-crunching can also offer macro-level insights for <a href=\"https://www.business.com/articles/11-tools-for-tracking-your-remote-staffs-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\">streamlining</a> or developing businesses, and find meaning that human managers don’t have the time or processing power to pursue. Of course, for an employee whose company contributions don’t always show up well on paper, it can make for a stressful day; in certain industries, such pressure can also force employees to put their <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/04/17/303770907/to-increase-productivity-ups-monitors-drivers-every-move\" target=\"_blank\">own safety at risk</a>.\n\nIn many offices, employers have similarly targeted productivity with software that monitors workers’ activity on company computers and networks — whether by <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/employer-gps-tracking/512294/\" target=\"_blank\">logging their keystrokes</a> or time spent on social media sites (or other forbidden ones), scanning emails for certain keywords, or periodically taking snapshots of what workers have onscreen. If you’re the kind of worker who needs a Twitter or gaming break every so often to keep creative juices flowing, or who’s trying to create connections on dating sites while at work, this kind of surveillance can obviously lead to some embarrassment, assuming you become aware of it, or to professional comeuppance. \n\nAt some companies, methods for employee monitoring at the office have even branched out to include the body. A firm called Humanyze has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/09/07/this-employee-badge-knows-not-only-where-you-are-but-whether-you-are-talking-to-your-co-workers/?utm_term=.da4099d7c711\" target=\"_blank\">started equipping firms</a> with badges that register not only employees’ movements at the workplace, but also the duration and tone of conversations between coworkers, and physical indicators of employee mood. According to the technology’s creators, the badges can help companies understand how employees collaborate in shared workspaces, as well as explore how individuals experience and pass the day. \n\nEmployee monitoring has even entered the medical space in a growing number of companies, with <a href=\"https://qz.com/380634/this-is-how-fitbit-employees-monitor-each-others-health/\" target=\"_blank\">fitness trackers such as FitBit</a> playing a central role. In some cases, it’s part of an overall supervision scheme to make sure employees are performing at peak ability (and making conducive lifestyle choices), as demonstrated by at least one high-stakes <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgans-employee-surveillance-program-2015-4\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street operator</a>. \n\nIn other cases, employees have been encouraged or effectively compelled to provide their personal bio-feedback as part of company wellness programs, either to receive healthcare discounts or avoid penalties; soon, some may even be required to provide <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2017/03/14/gop-bill-could-force-employees-to-undergo-dna-testing-or-pay-thousands/#35c5a0ef71fe\" target=\"_blank\">their DNA</a>. Whether such wellness programs <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/03/15/corporate-health-wellness-programs/\" target=\"_blank\">actually work</a>, technologically enabled or otherwise, remains dubious. \n\nAs useful as all this data may be, however, privacy and employment experts urge companies to take responsibility for what they’re collecting, and consider the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/technology/workplace-surveillance-sees-good-and-bad.html\" target=\"_blank\">wide potential impacts</a> for their workers — whether the law requires it or not. \n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://daniels.du.edu/directory/corey-ciocchetti/\" target=\"_blank\">Corey Ciocchetti</a>, an attorney and assistant professor of Business Ethics and Legal Studies at the University of Denver’s Daniels College of Business, the issue of employee monitoring can be approached in two ways: from a legal standpoint, and that of ethics. \n\n“Ethically, the less monitoring of employees there is, the better,” he explained by phone. “Legally, some kind of balance is appropriate.”\n\nAs part of his research on the evolving intersections of business and law, Ciocchetti published a <a href=\"https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The_Eavesdropping_Employer_%20A_Twenty-First_Century_Framework.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive article</a> in 2011 on the scope of known employee monitoring practices, detailing everything from computer surveillance and location-tracking to social network, text message, and voicemail monitoring. He found that, in the absence of consistent laws regulating how employers can monitor their employees (and, in some states, effectively any laws at all), private companies have broadly helped themselves to whatever worker data they can, and frequently without informing workers they’re being watched.\n\n“The problem is that the way companies are gathering data on employees is all hidden, and if they do disclose, it’s all in legalese,” Ciocchetti said. “The way many companies are doing it now is sneaky: they’ll secretly collect information, and use it against an employee in a lawsuit. The ethical thing is to tell people what you’re going to do, and if they don’t want to participate, you’re going to find yourself with no employees.” \n\nCiocchetti stressed that making employees aware that they’re being watched isn’t just an ethical matter, but also a practical one. If workers know how companies are checking up on them during the day, they’re more likely to accept those conditions that benefit the group, and offer feedback on those that don’t. \n\n“During work hours, having a secure workplace is a good idea. That can include monitoring emails, which helps companies avoid intellectual property theft, as well as prevent liability and protect employees in cases of sexual harassment or violence.” Ciocchetti said he’s aware of numerous examples of when violent or sexually inappropriate content in an employee’s company email account was detected by their employers, either before or after such behavior was reportedly by a colleague.\n\n“Companies save themselves a lot of money that way, by catching inappropriate behavior through monitoring. But there has to be a balance — and when they monitor employees without telling them how they do it, it’s a real morale killer,” he said. \n\nRegarding privacy rules around how private companies can monitor workers, Ciocchetti pointed out that they’re typically made following instances of complaint from employees, sometimes after they’ve decided to move on. For this reason, and to ensure workers’ data won’t <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/12/technology/verizon-data-leaked-online/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">be exposed</a> or <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/17/castlight-pregnancy-data/\" target=\"_blank\">taken advantage of</a>, it’s vital that companies set their own standards for monitoring and privacy sooner rather than later, and do so in a way that lets employees be in on the arrangement.\n\n“The law is always retroactive, and I wouldn’t hope for congress to pass [a relevant privacy legislation] anytime soon,” he said. “So, states are eventually going to make 50 of them, which is burdensome for employers to navigate, whether or not they operate around the country. And in most cases, they defer to the most conservative stance on the issue — usually California’s.”\n\nWhen issues of privacy infringement do arise, it’s often the result of what smaller businesses have been doing, too, Ciocchetti said. “Not all of them know the law, and the technology to monitor employees is inexpensive.” Meanwhile, large firms with their (typically) proportionately large legal teams have mostly gone uncontested with wide-ranging employee monitoring programs, leaving individuals and privacy advocates holding a cache of unresolved concerns.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ciocchetti said (at which time he thinks companies should stop snooping, incidentally), both employees and employers should be in the habit of carefully considering the state of surveillance in the workplace, and the limits of their privacy. For workers, he recommended finding out what in-house monitoring practices are, and keeping personal activities limited to personal technology as much as possible: “If you want something to stay private, use your own email account on your own phone on your own network,” he said.\n\nFor employers, he advised honesty toward the people they’ve already agreed to trust with the business’ well-being (which, as it happens, enables their own). “Disclose what you’re monitoring, and let everyone be adults,” Ciocchetti said.\n\nAnd if, as an employer, you’re still not sure which methods of monitoring are right for your office, you can always just ask your employees — be it through an ID-verified online poll or the humble suggestion box.\n\nAfter all, your employees’ highly evolved processing abilities — and not their data — is what you’re paying them for.\n\n*Illustration by Tin Nguyen*\n","cover":{"title":"DataOffice by Tin Nguyen","description":"By Tin Nguyen for Managed by Q","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5eJAOLWJIAYec4wC2wQaaQ/a5ea5eb5ba997c07feaf766624c26a1a/mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1200x800.png","details":{"size":1030949,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1200x800.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"coverId":"5eJAOLWJIAYec4wC2wQaaQ","featuredImage":{"title":"DataOffice 1422x1608 by Tin Nguyen","description":"By Tin Nguyen for Managed by Q","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3kyzHt1EyIyWOg4G2CiQuC/dfdc9dc6933007ba8b90ef484edc3bfc/mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1422x1608.png","details":{"size":761266,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1422x1608.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"3kyzHt1EyIyWOg4G2CiQuC","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"3F7RaR6BMAKCEMGImyWqoQ","name":"Janet Burns","shortBio":"Janet is a freelance writer living in Brooklyn, NY, and can be found via warmlyjanetburns.com.","headshotId":"320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ","headshotImage":{"title":"Janet Burns author photo","description":"Janet Burns author photo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ/461a2f17b03ecc8818a0e627efb3a601/park_headshot.jpg","details":{"size":544905,"image":{"width":1364,"height":1364}},"fileName":"park headshot.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"slideshowImages":[]},{"id":"3Z3ObdA2UMMCQoUICsYMYu","slug":"designing-an-office-where-your-whole-team-can-thrive","publicationDate":"2016-09-29T00:00-05:00","modifiedDate":"2017-02-22T16:37:03.543Z","type":"Default","title":"Designing an Office Where Your Whole Team Can Thrive","subtitle":"We explore strategies to design your office to support the productivity and happiness of all team members.","body":"![SeatGeek Office](//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5ulb9shEDm8qiEUoOQW6GW/8f1c0f8db0519c468328eff85d75727b/SpacestoThrive.jpeg)\nFrom Facebook and Google to Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg, open-plan offices have become the norm for workplaces over the last decade. These office spaces makes use of large, open spaces and minimizes the use of walled-off rooms or private offices. In fact, <a href=\"http://qz.com/85400/moving-to-open-plan-offices-makes-employees-less-productive-less-happy-and-more-likely-to-get-sick/\" target=\"_blank\">70% of Americans work</a> in offices with open-plan layouts today.\n# So, what makes open-plan offices so popular?\nThe theory is that open, airy working environments help to boost creativity and collaboration, all in the spirit of fostering a strong company culture.\n\nA 2010 study entitled '<a href=\"http://hum.sagepub.com/content/63/5/609.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Employee reactions to office redesign in Human Relations</a>' found that adopting an open-plan office layout did yield positive changes in employee perceptions of organizational culture. Employees who worked in open-plan offices tended to feel their company culture was more innovative and less formal.\n\nThe study also found that those in an open layout felt more encouragement to collaborate with team members than the study’s control group, who had not moved to an open-plan layout.\n\nHowever, a bunch of new data suggests that the open-plan approach could be a little too simplistic. And when it comes to office layout, one size doesn’t quite fit all.\n\nDifferent personalities thrive in different environments. Open-plan layouts favor extroverts and tend to have a negative influence on introverts — *who make up somewhere between <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-cain/introverts-_b_1432650.html\" target=\"_blank\">one-third and half</a> of the American population.*\n# What’s the difference between introverts and extroverts?\nIn *Fast Company*, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career\" target=\"_blank\">Belle Beth Cooper explains</a>:\n\n__Introverts__ (or those with introverted tendencies) tend to recharge by spending time alone. They lose energy from being around people for long periods of time, particularly large crowds.\n\n__Extroverts__, on the other hand, gain energy from other people. Extroverts actually find their energy is sapped when they spend too much time alone. They recharge by being social.\n\nThe open-office concept first came around in Germany in the 1950s, when the idea of Bürolandschaft *(office landscape)* was introduced. Office landscape looked to break the norm of many identical rows of desks or long tables and intended to provide a more collaborative work environment.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.opp.com/en/About-OPP/News/1507-Survey-Type-and-work-environment\" target=\"_blank\">Research suggests</a>, however, that any such benefits from open-plan office layouts are outweighed by the negative effects, such as noise levels, lack of privacy and distraction *(and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2014/06/04/office-design-for-introverts-by-an-introvert/\" target=\"_blank\">every interruption doubles the time it takes to complete a task</a>).*\n# The modern office is broken\nThough <a href=\"http://qz.com/85400/moving-to-open-plan-offices-makes-employees-less-productive-less-happy-and-more-likely-to-get-sick/\" target=\"_blank\">most people work in open-plan office layouts</a>, very few would choose to if they had the option. That was one of the key findings from an OPP study called <a href=\"https://www.opp.com/en/About-OPP/News/1507-Survey-Type-and-work-environment\" target=\"_blank\">*Type and Work Environment*</a>, which looked at how people with different personalities felt about the places in which they work.\n\nThe study also found that those who worked in smaller, shared offices were more satisfied with their jobs, and there were significant differences in workplace preferences between introverts and extroverts.\nMatching personality types to work environments can have a huge impact on workplace comfort and satisfaction for varying personality types.\n\nWhen an employee’s personality is matched with the nature of their work environment, they are likely to report less anxiety and discomfort, and more job satisfaction and social support, than those employees where there is a mismatch.\n# The future of office layouts: Four factors that can lead to a happier team\nSo, if office layouts are broken, what’s the solution?\n\nThere are several factors that could lead to greater happiness, and help both introverts and extroverts thrive.\n\n__1. Create designated quiet areas__\n\nWhen surveyed, introverts and extroverts both liked the idea of having designated quiet areas within the office.\n\nQuiet areas should be places where anyone in the office can go to break away to get some focused time in a peaceful, non-disruptive environment. If possible, try not to make quiet spaces feel like meeting rooms. Team members shouldn’t need to book a time in the quiet space or feel like they’re putting someone else out by being there.\n\nThe need for personal, quiet spaces seems to be a growing trend. A study by the architecture and design firm Gensler found that workers in 2013 spent 54 percent of their time on work requiring individual focus, up from 48 percent in 2008.\n\n__2. Let everyone have their own desk (or customizable workspace)__\n\nA micro-trend has emerged in some offices whereby no one has a designated workspace and everyone moves around each day — a phenomenon also known as hot desking. However, the majority of workers (both extroverts and introverts) want to have their own space.\n\nEncouraging workers to personalize their workspace with their own belongings also can lead to increased satisfaction. Even if you work in a hot desking environment, try to ensure that there is the facility to personalize space or belongings. Even seemingly small things like personalizing laptops with stickers can make a difference.\n\n__3. Break large offices into smaller layouts__\n\nWithin your office, try to create the illusion of smallness and intimacy by careful attention to design and layout.\n\nPeople who work in smaller spaces are on average more satisfied with their work environment, more satisfied with their job, and happier at work.\n\nWhere possible, try moving away from workplaces with very large numbers of people. Instead of having rows of 20 people all grouped together, try to make smaller, more intimate layouts with clusters of four to five people instead.\n\nWorking in a seemingly smaller environment is particularly important for introverts. And it’s important to remember that introverts make up between <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-cain/introverts-_b_1432650.html\" target=\"_blank\">one-third and half</a> of the population.\n\n__4. Welcome noise in loud spaces__\n\nJust as quiet spaces can benefit introverts, louder spaces can make extroverts feel more comfortable. One of the best ways to create a louder, more social space in the office is to monitor where people naturally congregate to chat. For example, a few sets of desks by the water cooler could be a great way to naturally create a louder area for gathering within your office space.\n\nIt’s important for office management or HR to think about the way an office is organized in order to cater to both introverts and extroverts. Observing the way people organically treat workspace can be a great way to start, as you’ll likely notice small pockets of loud and quiet space occurring naturally.\nMoving away from an open plan office may not always be possible due to space and cost restrictions. However, with careful attention to office layout and design, it’s possible to create a space that allows both introverts and extroverts to flourish.\n# What’s your team’s personality type?\nA great starting point could be to assess your team and figure out the split between introverts and extroverts in your workplace. One way to discover this information is through <a href=\"http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/\" target=\"_blank\">Myers-Briggs assessments</a>. The results of Myers-Briggs assessments will help to map employee tendencies toward: Extroversion vs. Introversion, Intuition vs. Sensing, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judging vs. Perceiving. With a deeper understanding of each member of your team, you can begin to picture how your office layout could affect their performance and what the best solutions may be.\n\nThe people on your team who lean more towards introversion will likely be happier and more productive in quieter spaces, whereas the extroverts may want a busier, louder space to work. With this knowledge you can begin to piece together a layout that works for everyone.\n\nThe end result will likely be a hybrid office that incorporates a range of spaces and gives employees the opportunity to move between them throughout the day. Those who thrive in busier, vibrant and loud environments will be able to choose to work in a space where they feel at home. Those who prefer the opposite will be able to reside, and flourish, in a quieter area and avoid the barrage of distractions that have become characteristic of the modern workplace.","cover":{"title":"SeatGeek Office","description":"Open Plan Office","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5ulb9shEDm8qiEUoOQW6GW/8f1c0f8db0519c468328eff85d75727b/SpacestoThrive.jpeg","details":{"size":116096,"image":{"width":800,"height":533}},"fileName":"SpacestoThrive.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"5ulb9shEDm8qiEUoOQW6GW","featuredImage":{"title":"SeatGeek Office","description":"Open Plan Office","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5ulb9shEDm8qiEUoOQW6GW/8f1c0f8db0519c468328eff85d75727b/SpacestoThrive.jpeg","details":{"size":116096,"image":{"width":800,"height":533}},"fileName":"SpacestoThrive.jpeg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"5ulb9shEDm8qiEUoOQW6GW","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"1pJbY8ANIYcCsyke2aSWI6","name":"Ash Read","shortBio":"Ash Read is a London-based contributing writer for All Hands.

But what to do when much of contemporary workforce was educated at a time when the focus was still on the three R’s, and not the six C’s? \n \nReal collaboration isn’t always easy, even for adults – or maybe especially for adults. Egos can get in the way, along with competing goals and communication styles, interpersonal issues, and other challenges to productive teamwork. But it’s worth learning to do well at any age. \n \nCollaboration – when it’s done right – means better workflows, stronger relationships, and projects that are improved by contributions from diverse perspectives and skillsets. \n \nHere’s how to cultivate collaboration that works: \n\n \n### Think about what collaboration is, and what it isn’t\n\n \nCollaboration is all about working together productively. If collaboration doesn’t lead you to the best product possible, it’s not really collaboration. A team of people who are incredibly nice to one another, but are also afraid to be honest, can be just as damaging to a project as a group where people are in constant conflict.  \n \n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/business/corner-office-jane-park-of-julep-to-succeed-fly-like-a-bumblebee.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Park, Chief Executive of Julep, puts it this way</a>: “It’s not about giving up control and saying, hey, whatever everybody wants… Collaboration isn’t consensus. It’s deliberate, and it’s a way of letting people in that is genuine but still very results-focused. It’s something I learned as a consultant — if there’s a faster path, I want to take it, and often you find the faster path by asking somebody else. It’s not about sitting in a room and trying to figure it out yourself.” \n\n \n### Be clear about your goal(s)\n\n \nCollaboration can go sideways even if everyone involved has the best intentions. One major reason: people are working against each other without even knowing it. Be clear to define your goals at the outset of any project. \n\nFor day-to-day collaboration, it’s key that companies have clearly defined, organization-wide goals (and that everyone actually knows what they are). This will mean that people from different departments – who will often have very different objectives – can also easily recognize and contribute to their ultimate shared objective. \n\n \n### Hire well \n\n\nOn the subject of fostering collaboration, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPYLZ7I6gs\" target=\"_blank\">Apple CEO Tim Cook highlights the importance of hiring the right team</a>: “Look for people that are not political, people that are not bureaucrats. People that really don’t care who gets credit… You look for people who appreciate different points of view. You look for people that care enough that they have an idea at 11 at night and they want to call and talk to you about it.” \n \nAnd while collaboration is a skill to prioritize when you look at job candidates, shifting your hiring process to a collaborative model can be a game changer in and of itself. Collaborative hiring includes employees in the interview process, connecting them with candidates and including their input when coming to a decision. \n \nWilliam Vanderbloemen highlights a few of the reasons that collaborative hiring work in a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamvanderbloemen/2016/08/18/5-reasons-why-you-should-have-a-collaborative-hiring-process/#5c5e0a5c7641\" target=\"_blank\">2016 article for Forbes</a>. At the top of his list is this: “Hiring collaboratively… drastically decreases the risk of bad hires and ensures that any new hire will fit in well with the team culture. Hiring collaboratively will also remind your current team of the incredible value added by a quality new hire.”\n\n\n### Create diverse teams\n\n \n<a href=\"https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/news-events/all-news/search-news/the-case-for-diversity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Researchers at the University of Michigan</a> found that teams made up exclusively of highly skilled members performed worse than teams with varying skills and levels and knowledge when given a complex problem. \n \nWhy? Because diverse perspectives lead to a diversity of ideas, with team members asking new questions and seeing opportunities that a group of similar people might not. \n\n\n### Balance ambition, creativity, openness to experience, and conscientiousness\n\n \n<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3068194/work-smart/a-psychologist-finally-explains-why-you-hate-teamwork-so-much\" target=\"_blank\">These four personality traits can have an incredible impact on a team’s performance</a>. A team where any one of them dominates can run itself right into the ground. \n \nSpeaking of dominance, a team with too many highly ambitious people can be a breeding ground for misplaced competition. Team members could compete with one another, rather than actual competitors. \n \nA team that’s high on creativity and openness to experience will have great ideas, but might have trouble turning any of them into reality. \n \nAn overly conscientious team might get caught up doing the fairest thing, rather than choosing the best way forward. \n \nMake sure to have people that can bring the best of each personality type to any given project. Your outcome measurements will thank you. \n\n\n### Take breaks together \n\n \nThe Swedish word fika essentially means coffee break, but really it’s so much more. Coffee (and probably a delicious treat) is a part of things, but so is conversation and a sense of connection that’s missing from many North American offices. \n \nThis is how it works: twice a day, every day, <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/aditi-ramesh-build-culture-transferwise\" target=\"_blank\">everyone in the office takes a break. At the same time. Together.</a> \n \nLet that idea settle in. Imagine the sense of togetherness and collaboration this kind of practice could inspire. \n \n<a href=\"https://qz.com/636682/this-four-letter-word-is-the-swedish-key-to-happiness-at-work/\">Viveka Adelsward, a Swedish professor, describes what happens during fika</a>, “We meet under informal circumstances, exchange information and comment on what’s happening. The hierarchy breaks down… we’re all in it together regardless of power and position.” \n \nAdelsward notes that taking breaks actually increases productivity, even in a country where only 1% of employees work overtime. \n \nConversations over fika cover everything from current events to work projects. People have the chance to share insights across departments, even if they never formally work together. “We get a chance to blow the dust off our brains, fill them with inspiration from others, and have an opportunity to test our thoughts and ideas.” \n \nEven if you aren’t quite ready to go full fika, the impact of creating strong social relationships on overall collaboration cannot be underestimated. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/11/eight-ways-to-build-collaborative-teams\" target=\"_blank\">A Harvard Business Review</a> report found that the most “productive and innovative” complex collaborative teams had something in common: “In every case the company’s top executives had invested significantly in building and maintaining social relationships throughout the organization.” \n \nCultivating true collaboration is not one-time deal. To work together well, companies must develop patterns of working and relating that echo through the organization. Find the right people, and put them together with a purpose – or let them relax – to let the magic happen. Repeat as needed. \n \n","cover":{"title":"q-collaboration-h","description":"Photo by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/6iG6AcValUiwGUG2ucaoaa/16d1b55466f0e13709f555067f1ed558/q-collaboration-h.jpg","details":{"size":200517,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"q-collaboration-h.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"6iG6AcValUiwGUG2ucaoaa","featuredImage":{"title":"q-collaboration-v","description":"Photo by Nick Dunlap","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/1fZS6zv4fiS6kc2MoU0g2q/1b9e42cda8e7a37e5b311b04d23d8838/q-collaboration-v.png","details":{"size":2867545,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"q-collaboration-v.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"1fZS6zv4fiS6kc2MoU0g2q","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"6dWhf0xdpmqCYqWYQuWK0S","name":"Ange Friesen","shortBio":"Ange Friesen is a writer and content strategist currently based in Toronto.

From *Iron Man’s* J.A.R.V.I.S. to the very personal assistant in Her (or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3RHYNZplWg\" target=\"_blank\">*Black Mirror‘s*</a> horrifying version), these fictional artificial intelligences let us explore our hopes and fears for the technology.   \n\nAnd the AI takeover isn’t just onscreen. Though certain kinds of human-machine harmony shown by Hollywood may be a ways off, artificial intelligence is already part of our lives, from daily talks with sassy Siri and mild-mannered Cortana to the complex, virtual butler built by <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3066478/mind-and-machine/mark-zuckerberg-jarvis\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. \n\nBeyond our homes and phones, AI also plays a key role in <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertadams/2017/01/10/10-powerful-examples-of-artificial-intelligence-in-use-today/#465f6f051ae6\" target=\"_blank\">workplaces around the world</a>. In addition to its growing use in manufacturing, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-robot-army-has-grown-by-50-2017-1\" target=\"_blank\">order fulfillment</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4078578.html\" target=\"_blank\">hospitality</a>, many companies have increasingly <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/samsung-millions-artificial-intelligence-virtual-reality-startups/\" target=\"_blank\">turned to AI</a> for managing certain office tasks in order to enrich and free up (human) employees' time. Across various industries, teams are using AI for their research, administration, communication, and even for discovering new roles for the tech they never knew they needed to fill. \n\n## The rise of the Chatbots\n\nOn the simpler side of AI, a regiment of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-05/chatbots-are-your-newest-dumbest-co-workers\" target=\"_blank\">friendly chatbots</a> has begun assisting workers with day-to-day internal operations. These customizable learning algorithms can perform a range of tasks, from scheduling flights and meetings to fielding frequently asked questions and recording when team members text in sick. They can take care of all this without–and potentially faster than–human help. Currently, they’re particularly handy with activities that involve gathering, sharing, or comparing information when grey matter’s insights aren’t really required. \n\nAs <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/30/how-a-conversational-chatbot-will-change-how-we-work/\" target=\"_blank\">VentureBeat</a> explained last year, chatbots can help teams save time with certain rote, routine tasks by letting users request and receive support directly, rather than by trying different channels (or interrupting someone’s flow). The wildly popular work communication platform Slack, for one, now has many <a href=\"https://botlist.co/platforms/5-slack\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds of specialized bots</a>, including about <a href=\"https://slack.com/apps/category/At0MQP5BEF-bots\" target=\"_blank\">200 from the company</a>. Many are designed to improve productivity by quickly giving teams the info they want or need, either automatically or on demand, with tasks ranging from employee onboarding and news or channel summaries to fixing times zones and supplying a hearty meme stream. And they’re <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/slack-now-with-600-apps-on-its-platform-pours-2m-into-11-slackbot-startups-via-its-slack-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">multiplying fast</a>.\n\nCustom bots for analyzing and integrating data have also been giving a leg up to content-focused teams, including major media. As <a href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/article-performance-serving-ads-publishers-using-slack-bots/\" target=\"_blank\">Digiday</a> reported, both Buzzfeed and the <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/08/the-new-york-times-built-a-slack-bot-to-help-decide-which-stories-to-post-to-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\">*New York Times*</a> have reportedly found success using algorithms to track or even predict how content performs online and across social media, and for prompting action based on that data. Meanwhile, *The Economist* and *Wall Street Journal* are using AI to help manage their editorial workflow and supply up-to-date news data, according to the site. \n\nOf course, bringing bots into the office fold doesn’t always have to be so complex. James Sherrett, senior manager of accounts for Slack’s European headquarters, had this advice for the Slackbot-curious: “Start with something small that is a repetitive task that is better suited for a computer to do,” he told *Digiday*. “[It] can be lightweight like asking the Wifi code or the postal address for another office, but by adding that capability you’re not disturbing someone else’s workflow with small questions.”\n\n## Conversing with robots\n\nFor many workplaces, being able to interface with AI in plain, spoken language also makes the tech a timesaver. Voice recognition systems, like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, had their stumbles at first, but their adaptive algorithms have improved quickly. Voice recognition systems have spent the past several years getting up to speed and are now in widespread use in the workplace.\n\nAt Chicago-based UX design and development agency <a href=\"https://www.codal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codal</a>, language-based AI takes the form of Amazon Echo devices, which are placed strategically in executive offices and conference rooms. The team explained by email that voice recognition AI enables staff to be more flexible during meetings because they can be laptop-free and use verbal commands to take notes, perform quick research, or build a to-do list. “In my office, I use Alexa to remind me of upcoming meetings, and what each day forecasts in terms of conference calls and important tasks,” COO Matt Gierut said.\n\nFor other simple AI-related tasks, like ordering office supplies or adjusting their connected thermostat, Codal also turns to Alexa and its straightforward, spoken commands, but the algorithms don’t stop there. “We also use <a href=\"https://www.restlessbandit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Restless Bandit</a>, a talent discovery tool that uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to find the best talent for our open positions,” said CEO Keval Baxi. “This tool quickly sorts through resumes that may or may not fit the career description, and saves our HR department hours of time.” \n\n## Towards self-aware Artificial Intelligence\n\nIn the near future, AI may start to take on more decision-heavy office tasks, provided we help them (and let them) get there. Professor Manuela Veloso, head of machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks intelligent systems are gearing up for much more hands-on roles in a wide array of workplaces. “In five or ten years, I believe that virtually intelligent systems, such as [virtual assistants] on phones and computers, will be amazing, and they’ll assist humans with an enormous range of applications,” she explained by phone.\n\n“Such machines may help doctors search for recommendations on difficult cases, scientists with research, and even consumers with personal decisions about the pros and cons of insurance plans, or something you want to buy,” she said. “The amount of things I believe AI will be able to help with is endless, and the data available for AI systems is increasing every day.”\n\nAs AI takes on more responsibility and even bodily form (as in the case of Veloso’s guest-guiding <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/carnegie-mellon-cobots-are-the-future-of-a-i/\" target=\"_blank\">CMU CoBots</a>), however, Veloso also believes that AI will need to gain appropriate depth. In order to build trust with these systems, she said, users will need to experience more than the system’s ever-improving digitized <a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/3067070/the-end-of-user-friendly-design/\" target=\"_blank\">human personality</a> (minor faults and mild emotional flare-ups sometimes included): they’ll need AI systems to be able to explain themselves.\n\n“When my CoBots come to my office, I ask them questions, like ‘Why are you late?’ and ‘What route did you take to get here?’” she said. According to Veloso, getting intelligent systems up to the task of explaining their reasoning in terms we’ll understand will be key to building effective, symbiotic, and certainly copacetic relationships with such machines. “It’s the same if a system recommends one car or insurance plan,” she said. “We need to be able to ask, ‘Why did you make this choice?’”\n\nVeloso also believes intelligent systems will even start handling office jobs that traditionally relied on the human touch. “In office environments, people need to guide visitors in the building, bring coffee or water, check things, reorganize physical space, and so on,” she said, “and that’s one area where people should someday expect change: in how the physical space of an office is going to be helped by mobile robots moving around.”\n\nUntil then, though, it’s likely best—at least in most offices—to keep our intelligent systems and beverages apart.\n\n\n*Illustration by Tin Nguyen*\n\n\n","cover":{"title":"mbq ah 002 robots 1200x800","description":"Robots in the office feed photo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/4MoyCmsKneEYy0S8SsaS2Q/e47e363ae1e96ba5974e04c027426786/mbq_ah_002_robots_1200x800.png","details":{"size":140759,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_002_robots_1200x800.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"coverId":"4MoyCmsKneEYy0S8SsaS2Q","featuredImage":{"title":"mbq ah 002 robots 1422x1608","description":"AI in the office ","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/6Fo84hhxhmWmk0uKAa4mQY/33d450d7cea7834ecdbb05df7336e214/mbq_ah_002_robots_1422x1608.png","details":{"size":283240,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_002_robots_1422x1608.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"6Fo84hhxhmWmk0uKAa4mQY","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"3F7RaR6BMAKCEMGImyWqoQ","name":"Janet Burns","shortBio":"Janet is a freelance writer living in Brooklyn, NY, and can be found via warmlyjanetburns.com.","headshotId":"320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ","headshotImage":{"title":"Janet Burns author photo","description":"Janet Burns author photo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ/461a2f17b03ecc8818a0e627efb3a601/park_headshot.jpg","details":{"size":544905,"image":{"width":1364,"height":1364}},"fileName":"park headshot.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"slideshowImages":[]},{"id":"W0ijoo3OQSASuI00QSGwg","slug":"meditation-mindfulness-workplace","publicationDate":"2017-03-14T00:00-05:00","modifiedDate":"2017-07-10T21:02:43.429Z","type":"Feature","title":"Put Meditation to Work: Inside the Mindfulness Movement","subtitle":"Meditation in the workplace can boost productivity and happiness.","body":"As the workday starts I sit in deep solitude, breathe deeply, and just let myself be. I am far from the morning madness of loading kids’ backpacks and heading to school, editor meetings, emails, and work demands. My morning meditation helps me set the tone for all that follows and I am able to face the demands of the day with a quiet focus.  \n\nWho knew 10 minutes could be such a powerful experience? As someone who's no stranger to work-induced anxiety and burnout, beginning a regular meditation practice has been a game changer. I feel more lucid on days that I've been loyal to my meditation practice; less likely to panic when an unexpected work hiccup arises. I also find it much easier to sit at my computer and focus on the tasks at hand. This is precisely why I often add a shorter afternoon meditation into my schedule, as well.\n\nMy own experience points to a growing meditation movement. Mindfulness training is becoming an increasingly popular offering in workplace wellness programs. Employees and managers alike are hungry for it, says Liz Wilkes, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.exubrancy.com/#home\" target=\"_blank\">Exubrancy</a>. The office wellness company provides an array of services aimed at enhancing employee well being, bringing everything from meditation to fitness to massage directly to the workplace.\n\n\"Anecdotally, participants in our programs have told us, 'This is the safest space in my company.' Or 'It was my weekly meditation classes that got me through this extraordinarily challenging personal time in my life,'\" she says.\n\nThe mindfulness phenomenon has been picking up steam over the last decade. As David Gelles, a New York Times business reporter and author of *Mindful Work*, told <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/corporations-newest-productivity-hack-meditation/387286/\" target=\"_blank\">The Atlantic's Joe Pinsker</a> in a 2015 interview, it first began blooming in the mid-1990s when large-scale companies began calling in experts to teach mindfulness techniques to executives. \n\nMonsanto was actually one of the first to dip its toes in the water, attracted to mindfulness as a way of fostering creativity among its top executives, according to mindful workplace expert <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-mindfulness-and-meditation-are-good-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Mirabai Bush</a>. General Mills was another early adopter. Janice Marturano, who founded its mindfulness program, told Gelles in a 2012 interview for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9cb7940-ebea-11e1-985a-00144feab49a\" target=\"_blank\">The Financial Times</a>: “It’s about training our minds to be more focused, to see with clarity, to have spaciousness for creativity, and to feel connected.” \n\nGoogle’s <a href=\"https://siyli.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Search Inside Yourself</a> initiative, which began in 2007, is perhaps the most popular mindfulness-based leadership program today. Bush, who helped Google get the program off the ground, shared some wonderful insights on the power of workplace mindfulness in a recent episode of the <a href=\"http://www.onbeing.org/program/mirabai-bush-search-inside-yourself-contemplation-in-life-and-work/7731\" target=\"_blank\">On Being</a> podcast. The story goes, it all began with one Google engineer who wanted to bring the benefits of meditation to the company at large.\n\nGoogle certainly doesn't stand alone. Aetna, Target, and Intel also have renowned employee wellness programs that spotlight meditation and mindfulness. Why the increase in popularity? Gelles partly credits the uptick to the abundance of research suggesting that meditation improves the quality of our work. \n\n## Why infuse the workday with meditation and mindfulness?\n\nSticking to a regular meditation practice is linked to some profound benefits. In 2015, Harvard neuroscientist Sara Lazar, Ph.D. told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/05/26/harvard-neuroscientist-meditation-not-only-reduces-stress-it-literally-changes-your-brain/?utm_term=.b2f3871a31d7\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Post</a> that just eight weeks of meditation can actually change the brain in areas that are linked to anxiety and fear, as well as empathy and human connection. And researchers at <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2013/04/enlightening-research-shows-meditation-boosts-compassion/\" target=\"_blank\">Northeastern University</a> are echoing what longtime meditators already know to be true—that meditation increases compassion. What's more, it's associated with improved mental health and cognitive functioning.\n\nSo what does this have to do with the workplace? There appears to be a huge carryover between these personal benefits and our professional lives.\n\n\"There's a lot of data out there on the ROI and benefits of meditation related to decreased absenteeism, and increased productivity,\" says Logan Sugarman, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.refreshbody.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Refresh Body</a>, a wellness concierge service for individuals and corporations. \"By making it an integral part of your work life, it helps relieve stress factors in the employee's life, and makes them a little less anxious as they navigate their workday.\"\n\nIlya Pozin calls out some noteworthy research in this 2014 <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/ilya-pozin/can-mindfulness-improve-your-productivity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Inc. article</a>, specifically when it comes to boosting productivity. According to the INSEAD Business School, mindfulness meditation can pave the way for more rational thinking and better business decisions. Pozin also points to studies suggesting that mindfulness just might infuse the workplace with more happiness and creativity.\n\nAnd another benefit? Employers that offer meditation and other mindfulness-focused wellness programs appear to have higher employee retention. While it's tough to find hard numbers on this one, Josh Bersin at <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/03/13/culture-why-its-the-hottest-topic-in-business-today/#26fc6f47b6e2\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes</a> draws a close relationship between companies that offer these types of programs and those that have a positive work culture where employees are invested and engaged.\n\nThose who facilitate meditation sessions have seen the benefits first hand. \"It's a water-cooler effect whereby you're getting groups from different teams, like accounting, marketing, and upper management all having a shared experience that they can discuss, which creates a common bond,\" explains Sugarman.\n\n## Simple mindfulness techniques to try\n\nWilkes has a bit of advice for office managers and other team members looking to bring mindfulness into the company culture: don't over-think it. \n\n\"I'd highly recommend a single workshop or short series of meditation classes before diving into a deeper commitment,\" she says. \"At Exubrancy we've been very fortunate to find that once we do introduce people to mindfulness training and meditation sessions, they become very, very sticky because they become such an important part of people's week.\"\n\nEven if your company doesn’t offer workplace meditation (yet), here are a few simple mindfulness techniques to get you started:\n\n__Focus On Your Breath:__ Disconnect from all electronics and find a comfortable place to sit. Natural outdoor settings are ideal, but a quiet place in the office will do the trick. Spend five to 10 minutes taking deep, cleansing breaths. When thoughts arise, and they will, gently redirect your attention back to your breath.\n\n__Opt for a Mindful Lunch:__ The great Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh popularized the practice of eating with intention, known as mindful eating. Get away from your computer screen and honor your meal; chew slowly and make it a point to really taste your food. Instead of going through the motions of eating so you can move on to your next task, be present for every bite.\n\n__Consider Technology-Enabled Meditation:__ Wilkes is a fan of the <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace app</a>, which you can think of as a portable, on-demand meditation trainer. While at your desk, consider running the <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Calm.com</a> homepage in the background. It provides ambient sounds and soothing images to help keep you centered.\n\nThink your calendar is too crammed to incorporate a few minutes of quiet reflection into your workday? As the ancient Zen proverb goes: “You should sit in meditation for twenty minutes every day—unless you're too busy. Then you should sit for an hour.\" \n\n*Illustration by Annette Wong*\n","cover":{"title":"mindfulness-meditation","description":"Mindfulness full size Annette Wong","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/330NVPDDFCc0gSSQIW8KuI/5c8702943c222af9ded98cd5f0087826/mindfulness-meditation.jpg","details":{"size":132258,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1601}},"fileName":"mindfulness-meditation.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"330NVPDDFCc0gSSQIW8KuI","featuredImage":{"title":"meditation cropped","description":"Meditation at work by Annette Wong","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3dLlE2vG6kMK0202Agu8Cc/1c6223d5dd911fde43aea7e8e8cb90ae/meditation_cropped.png","details":{"size":167042,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"meditation_cropped.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"3dLlE2vG6kMK0202Agu8Cc","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"2NTHSZfR0QYaMyIC2Gec0q","name":"Marianne Hayes","shortBio":"Marianne Hayes is a longtime writer, storyteller and devoted bookworm.

","body":"Office settings aren't typically known for lush greenery and environmental harmony, but adding a little plant life to your workplace can be an unexpected booster for workplace well-being. \n\n\"We're programmed to exist in a world with a certain amount of sunlight and greenery around us,\" says Christopher Satch, head of plant science and education at <a href=\"https://www.thesill.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sill</a>, a Manhattan-based plant shop and nursery that specializes in indoor greens. \"We've actually removed a lot of that from our lives; we live in houses, cities, and office buildings, and a lot of these places usually don't have any plants at all and are totally removed from nature.\" \n\nIf your office boasts more florescent lighting than leafy foliage, you might want to perk up and read on. Infusing your workspace with plant life, it turns out, just might make for happier, healthier, more productive employees.\n\nDo plants actually improve well-being? The research says yes.\n\n### __They clean the air__\n\nThe science here is pretty robust, supporting a very real link between plants and overall well-being. Satch points to a now-famous 1989 <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930073077.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NASA study</a> showing that plants happen to be stellar air purifiers. We regularly interact with all sorts of things that release volatile organic compounds—electronics, plastics, paints, you name it. Plants naturally filter indoor air pollution, making our spaces cleaner and more habitable.\n\nResearchers at the <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2016/august/selecting-the-right-house-plant-could-improve-indoor-air-animation.html\" target=\"_blank\">State University of New York at Oswego</a> took it further in a 2016 study that found certain houseplants to be super effective at cleansing the air of harmful chemicals. Of the five common varieties they studied, the <a href=\"https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/houseplants/dracaena/dracaena-houseplant-care.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dracaena plant</a> was able to absorb roughly 95 percent of acetone from the air; the <a href=\"https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/houseplants/bromeliad/growing-bromeliad-plants.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bromeliad plant</a> removed over 80 percent of other volatile compounds. The findings are particularly noteworthy given the <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/sick-building-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Sick Building Syndrome</a> phenomenon, which experts say could get worse as <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-climate-change-could-make-office-work-even-unhealthier-180958815/\" target=\"_blank\">climate change takes hold</a>.\n\n\"We spend up to 90 percent of our time indoors on a daily basis, so we're breathing things in every day, so it's really important that we have plant life all around us,\" says Satch, adding that plants also serve as natural dust clings. \n\n### __They lower stress and promote good feelings__\n\nPlants do a whole lot more than just purify the air. Horticulturist Justin Hancock told <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/video/the-health-benefits-of-houseplants/74397C51-2DF4-4F0F-9DF5-204FC314F1F9.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Wall Street Journal</a> last year that they can also reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and promote calm and relaxation. Satch echoes similar sentiments, adding that most well-being benefits stem from a psychological response that leads to a biochemical response inside the body. \n\nOne 2015 study published in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419447/\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of Physiological Anthropology</a> echoes the same, suggesting that active interaction with indoor plants keeps stress at bay by suppressing the sympathetic nervous system and promoting soothing feelings. \n\n### __They give memory, cognition, and focus a boost__\n\nIf you're looking to get management on board with more plant life in the office, just refer them to this 2011 study published in the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494410001027?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of Environmental Psychology</a>. Here, researchers suggest that indoor plants prevent fatigue and increase focus, especially during attention-demanding work. Travis Riddle at <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/houseplants-make-you-smarter/\" target=\"_blank\">Scientific American</a> expounded on the theory, citing other research that draws an intimate link between exposure to natural environments and improved attention and productivity. \n\nWe can't help but wonder if visual cues have anything to do with it. One 2015 <a href=\"http://newsroom.melbourne.edu/news/glancing-grassy-green-roof-significantly-boosts-concentration\" target=\"_blank\">University of Melbourne Study</a> found that glancing at an image of a verdant rooftop garden for just 40 seconds markedly increased concentration.\n\n\"Green is actually one of the colors that's most easily perceived by the eye,\" adds Satch. \"<a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/color-for-work-productivity\" target=\"_blank\">Seeing green</a> unlocks certain chemical responses in the brain that boosts people's mood and helps them focus more.\"\n\nThe fact that plants also help reduce noise pollution could be another contributing factor; according to the <a href=\"http://managedbyq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review</a>, indoor plants help absorb background noise, making for quieter work environments.\n\n### __Incorporating greenery in the workplace__\n\nA green thumb isn't required to reap these benefits. To introduce your workspace to more greenery, Satch suggests beginning by taking stock of your setting. If you work in a windowless cubicle, your options are different than if you work in a sun-drenched open space.\n\n\"People tend to treat plants like a piece of furniture, using them to cover up wires or hide an ugly stain,\" says Satch. \"Plants are actually living creatures, so it's important to be mindful that they have certain needs. All we have to do is understand our plants and meet those needs, then it's actually really easy to keep a bunch of plants.\"\n\nSome rules of thumb: keep your plants as close to a window as possible. (The more light, the better.) If you have access to a lot of bright light, for example, cacti and palms are a great choice. For those who work in slightly darker settings, don't fret. Our team tapped the experts to track down a handful of <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/desktop-gardening-office-plants\" target=\"_blank\">durable, office-friendly plants that can thrive in pretty much any setting</a>. \n\nThe Sill also has an <a href=\"https://www.thesill.com/products/office-collection\" target=\"_blank\">entire collection</a> devoted to the workplace, featuring greens like the snake plant, ZZ plant and pothos, which all prefer moderate-to-low, indirect light. These are ideal if you're more than 10 feet away from a window.\n\nJust be aware of any radiators or air conditioning units; the last thing you want to do is cook or freeze your new plants to death. And when you purchase a new plant, it's always wise to clarify how often to water it. In the end, it really comes down to understanding the circumstances under which specific plants will flourish. \n\n\"Recreating that natural environment will help it thrive,\" says Erin Marino, The Sill's marketing director. \"You don't want to get a cactus if you have a really dark, ground-floor space. But if you have a huge, bright, sunny window that gets a lot of heat and sun, a cactus is going to do great there.\"\n\nIn other words, it pays to do a little research on the front end when cultivating your workplace jungle. And if you need expert help sourcing plants for your office and taking care of them, <a href=\"https://www.managedbyq.com/services\" target=\"_blank\">Managed by Q</a> offers plant design and care services. \n\n\n","cover":{"title":"PlantsInTheWorkplaceFeed","description":"Photo by Dominick Mastrangelo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/6IBthcC1rOuKsIWGyEcMcK/479376103357b0238919e9a2280db517/PlantsInTheWorkplaceFeed.jpg","details":{"size":3659081,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"PlantsInTheWorkplaceFeed.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"6IBthcC1rOuKsIWGyEcMcK","featuredImage":{"title":"Dominick Mastrangelo - the sill maplewood nj-7010","description":"Snake plants from The Sill","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/4mQ9fTjZzOIauMOqOS6aoI/bde5e6a4e0f33a88266b701ab1a5e088/Dominick_Mastrangelo_-_the_sill_maplewood_nj-7010.jpg","details":{"size":1518461,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"Dominick Mastrangelo - the_sill_maplewood_nj-7010.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"4mQ9fTjZzOIauMOqOS6aoI","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"2NTHSZfR0QYaMyIC2Gec0q","name":"Marianne Hayes","shortBio":"Marianne Hayes is a longtime writer, storyteller and devoted bookworm.
