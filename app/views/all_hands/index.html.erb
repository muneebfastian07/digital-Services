Offering a visitor a few kilobytes to check the news or weather now seems like a basic act of hospitality.\n\nWorkplaces have, of course, installed wireless networks to enable internet access for the phones, tablets and laptops on which they rely. Employees who connect their personal device to a few networks a week might notice something different about their office’s wifi: often, it’s awful.\n\n“Small businesses often get hurt because they don’t have the infrastructure for wifi and they don’t know how to manage the level of traffic they’re dealing with,” says Michael Kupfer, president of <a href=\"http://blackdiamondsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Diamond Solutions</a>, a Chicago-based IT consulting firm.\n\nEmployees may wonder why it takes longer for a webpage to load or video to buffer on their phone at work than it does at home (not that they’re checking ESPN or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFzpC_e44Tg\" target=\"_blank\">watching an octopus walk on land</a> while they’re supposed to be working or anything). In addition to being a pain and making a company seem technologically unprepared, slow internet diminishes productivity. One study trying to put a dollar or percentage point on the cost of slow internet found that waiting on a sluggish computer to finalize tasks that are otherwise ready to complete <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10361881/Britons-lose-five-and-a-half-days-a-year-from-slow-computers.html\" target=\"_blank\">decreases a company’s productivity by about two percent</a>.\n\nThere are several reasons why workplace wireless networks seem to lag behind others, but the biggest, many experts agree, is that businesses do not buy business-grade wifi systems.\n\n“They take whatever [router] the internet provider hands them and they think that should work, even if that’s not really business- or enterprise-grade hardware and can’t handle a large number of devices” says Ed Wright, chief technology officer of New York City-based <a href=\"http://www.sliceitup.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Slice Wireless Solutions</a>.\n\nMany businesses owners go to consumer electronics stores and purchase routers meant for a home. They become strained once connected to all the devices that pile into even a small office. \n\nIt’s important to remember the number of devices is usually greater than the number of employees. Companies “may estimate five or ten people, but each one of those people probably brings a laptop and a cellphone,” says Kupfer. “Plus guests and customers put their phones on the wifi.” In addition, peripheral devices, like printers and speakers, are increasingly connected to computers via wifi.\n\n“The number of people in your office isn’t as important as the amount of equipment,” says Ryan Denehy, founder of <a href=\"http://www.electric.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Electric</a>, a tech support company modeled for startups and small businesses.\n\nFor a user on an overwhelmed network, loading a basic webpage becomes a ’90s flashback to hooking into a dial-up in the family den, waiting for a Buffy the Vampire Slayer message board to load.\n\nEmployers who expect dozens of devices to suck up gigabytes from their router should invest in an industrial-grade one, capable of emitting a signal that will provide a whole company the kind of performance they expect at home or at Starbucks. Cisco, Arrowhead, Hewlett-Packard, and other well-known names in the computing and communications industries make them, and models suitable for a small business range between $300 and $500.\n\nWright says to think about it in terms of the kitchen needs of a home versus those of a culinary business: “Do you need two large ovens?” he asks “The answer is yes, if you are a professional baker.”\n\nThe industrial- or enterprise-grade systems also have some unique features, such as a means to monitoring who is using the most bandwidth and cutting that device off at a certain point (so you won’t be slowed by someone torrenting “Game of Thrones” on Monday morning).\n\nIf you have the shiniest new business-class router from a major manufacturer and your wifi is still running at the speed of a rural bus station’s, there are a few advanced problems to troubleshoot.\nOne problem might be the lack of bandwidth provided by the internet service provider. Some set-ups in commercial buildings are antiquated and rely on older equipment. “It’s very old-fashioned in terms of how all this work gets done,” says Denehy. “[A provider like] Verizon has to cut a deal with the city to do construction and put a fiber-optic cable in the building.”\n\nIf a landlord hasn’t received a request for an upgrade, they may not have had incentive to get new hardware installed recently, relying instead on older, slower setups that were fine for 2003 to deliver the final mile of connection. Denehy recommends asking your provider to send out a technician to review the equipment. \nAnother potential source of trouble: Another office in the building might be an inadvertent wifi bully. Some businesses with powerful systems make a lot of wifi “noise,” says Denehy, creating overwhelming competition in the atmosphere. \n\nSmarter than starting an arms race, says Denehy, is to hire a professional to recalibrate the effectiveness of your own system in your own space. This might mean installing several access points, strategically placed around the office. Devices in the vicinity will more easily be able to establish a strong connection to your system and block out the fog created by your technologically noisy neighbor.\n\nWith workplace productivity and basic business functions increasingly dependent on reliable wireless internet access, it pays to invest in business-grade equipment and work with professionals to ensure your access is uninterrupted. Whether you are setting up a network or looking to upgrade, <a href=\"http://managedbyq.com/services\" target=\"_blank\">Managed by Q</a> can work with you to configure new networks, troubleshoot issues, and solve for slow connections.\n\n*Photography by Melissa Morgan Walbridge*","cover":{"title":"Work Wifi Feed Image Melissa Wallbridge","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3QQfXcGedWmYAEK6q6m0AM/99d1f2f30187cd83eee92d2507ef1553/2017_08_29_AllHands_0477_FLAT.jpg","details":{"size":2583661,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"2017_08_29_AllHands_0477_FLAT.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"3QQfXcGedWmYAEK6q6m0AM","featuredImage":{"title":"Work Wifi feature image","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/26cVcbKOYgYkMc8eYowi8i/59a301c7410527845a135a78cb5d3668/2017_08_29_AllHands_0481_FLAT-2.jpg","details":{"size":1626390,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"2017_08_29_AllHands_0481_FLAT-2.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"26cVcbKOYgYkMc8eYowi8i","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"xLEDxDEDhQo2Mgs8iAgi6","name":"Nick Keppler","shortBio":"Nick Keppler is a Pittsburgh-based freelance writer whose work has appeared in AlterNet, The Village Voice, Mental Floss, Men’s Health, Vice, and Slate.","headshotId":"6JE956zppC8S2gWY24eCik","headshotImage":{"title":"Nick Keppler author photo","description":"Nick Keppler author photo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/6JE956zppC8S2gWY24eCik/65db28a13504ca489f6a14739801b314/Nick-JRP_3396-1.jpg","details":{"size":408726,"image":{"width":1785,"height":1829}},"fileName":"Nick-JRP_3396-1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"slideshowImages":[]},{"id":"6DfuZfTPgWOi08YgGm4MwO","slug":"eight-interview-questions-to-understand-company-culture","publicationDate":"2017-10-05T00:00-04:00","modifiedDate":"2017-10-05T19:41:08.176Z","type":"Feature","title":"Eight Interview Questions to Help You Understand a Company’s Culture","subtitle":"“Culture fit” can be difficult to gauge, but these questions can help you determine if a company is a good match for you. ","body":"\"Company culture\" is a buzzword we've all heard by now. As the name implies, it's a nod to a company's way of being—how their values and expectations shape the employee experience. Fitting in with the company vibe can make a huge difference when it comes to your professional growth and career happiness, but culture can be notoriously difficult to gauge. When you are interviewing for a job, how do you get a sense of how a company lives their values and the cultural expectations they have for their employees?  \n\nTo help guide job seekers, we tapped career experts who are immersed in the topic. These eight interview questions will help you get sense of a company’s culture and whether it’s a good fit for you.  \n\n\n### *What do most employees do for lunch?*\n\n\n\"I love this question,\" says longtime HR mentor and career coach <a href=\"http://www.nicoleraedrummond.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Drummond</a>. \"Are people eating sad salads at their desks? Or do small groups go out and get lunch together? Is there a dining area where people gather, even if it's just for 30 minutes? It's a question most people don't ask, so it's a great way to gauge the culture.\"\n\nA worthy follow-up is to ask about any regular social events. Connecting with fellow employees plays a major role in work happiness. Go beyond the water cooler and ask directly about routine get-togethers and other opportunities for fostering authentic connections.\n\n\n### *Can I take an office tour?*\n\n\nThis is a simple question that can reveal much about life at a particular office. Do you see closed cubicles or a collaborative, open-air setup? Take note of the dress code; are employees in straight-laced business attire or more self-expressive clothing?\n\nAn office tour is also an ideal time to ask the interviewer about what work styles the company supports. Is it a strict in-office, 9-to-5 policy? Or do employees have the option to, say, take their laptop to a local park to meet deadlines in the fresh air? Is working remotely on the table? You won't always know until you ask.\n\n\n### *How are employees recognized for their achievements (and failures)?*\n\n\nWhat happens when someone slam dunks a project? \n\n\"Is it just kudos on Slack or in an email, or is it a shout out at town hall?\" asks Drummond. \"Celebrating each other's successes, for me, is a big thing. We all want to be recognized; it can sometimes feel better than a raise!\"\n\nOn the flip side, what happens if you flop? A smart way to find out is to ask how they handle letting someone go, adds Drummond. On that note, if an employee is struggling to meet expectations, what kind of support does HR provide?\n\nWhat you're really trying to figure out with these questions is if the company encourages employees to try new approaches and take reasonable risks. \n\n\n### *How does this role fit into the overall company goals?*\n\n\nInstead of asking what the company values are, which might elicit a generic response, ask specifically how the job you're interviewing for plays into their big-picture objectives. In what way does it support the grander vision? This tack clarifies the impact you'll have at the company, while simultaneously highlighting their values.\n\n\n### *What is one characteristic all employees have in common?*\n\n\nAriel Lopez, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.2020shift.com/\" target=\"_blank\">2020Shift</a>, says this question will probably catch the interviewer off guard. (In a good way). \n\n\"Maybe it's something fresh and unexpected, like a great sense of humor,\" she says. \"You might get a cliché answer, like 'team players who are self-motivated,' but you might also get something more genuine and telling about the company culture.\"\n\n\n### *What are the growth opportunities like?*\n\n\nThis is a biggie. A solid culture fit goes hand in hand with feeling supported to learn and grow.\n\n\"Definitely ask what they look for when promoting individuals, and also what they look for in managers and their executive staff,\" says Lopez. \"If you can speak to people already in those senior positions, it'll probably give you a pretty good idea if you can actually go through that glass ceiling or not.\"\n\nInquiring about professional development and mentorship opportunities is another way to get a feel for the company's stance on employee growth.\n\n\n### *How do they embrace diversity and inclusion?*\n\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes \"culture fit\" is a subtle way in which employers practice unconscious bias (especially for candidates from non-majority backgrounds). \n\n\"This happens all the time,\" says Lopez, whose company focuses on helping tech and digital media companies diversify their recruitment process and retain minority talent. \"Underrepresented groups are uniquely affected.\" \n\nThis is precisely why diversity and inclusion practices are important to explore during the interview process. Lopez suggests asking for a specific example of how the company maintains an inclusive environment.\n\n\n### *What would your employees have to say about the company?*\n\n\n\"This is one of my favorite interview questions because it really catches people on the spot, so they don't have time to give a canned answer,\" says Lopez. \n\nPerhaps the best way to do tease out company culture is to connect with a past or present employee. Drummond recommends setting this up on your own—if you ask the interviewer, it'll be tough to decipher if the person they send you to is being genuine.\n\n\"Seek out another individual contributor who works there; it doesn't necessarily have to be someone on the team you're interviewing for,\" says Drummond. \n\nWhether you go through a shared connection or you send a cold email to someone you found on LinkedIn, what you're trying to uncover is what it's really like to work there. Lopez also says there's real value in chatting with former employees, who are more likely to speak openly about their experience.\n\nWhen you are able to get a sense of a company’s culture you will be better able to start your new job with confidence, knowing that you will be joining an environment where you can thrive. \n\n*Photography by Melissa Walbridge*\n","cover":{"title":"Cultural interview by Melissa Walbridge Feed","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/1FfTtoTyhS4yKKWO0O0qgg/848d622b18ea1b4da9c2e0a4fe272630/2017_08_29_AllHands_0046_FINAL.jpg","details":{"size":2207935,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"2017_08_29_AllHands_0046_FINAL.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"1FfTtoTyhS4yKKWO0O0qgg","featuredImage":{"title":"Cultural Interview by Melissa Wallbridge","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3zW8wIR9QAKISC4KcGKQGW/c9353e69d909c628953cde29a830e153/2017_08_29_AllHands_0121-3.jpg","details":{"size":5215520,"image":{"width":2844,"height":3216}},"fileName":"2017_08_29_AllHands_0121-3.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"3zW8wIR9QAKISC4KcGKQGW","category":{"id":"5JOHUh9UXYGeOgICqoGEOi","name":"Career Focus","slug":"career-focus"},"author":{"id":"2NTHSZfR0QYaMyIC2Gec0q","name":"Marianne Hayes","shortBio":"Marianne Hayes is a longtime writer, storyteller and devoted bookworm.

The jobs he’d envisioned for himself were nowhere to be found. Then he saw an ad of a company seeking a “Manager Of Tomorrow.”\n\n“I said, ‘Great! Sign me up!’” Jan laughs. He didn’t quite know what he was getting into, but he needed a job. The interviews led to a job offer with a recruiting agency, where he began his career. After two years, he moved to his first startup, a mobile gaming company.\n\nIt would be the first of four tech startups he would join over the next four years; he would also move with his wife from Berlin to the UK and finally to New York in 2014. In New York he joined Oscar, the health insurance startup, to grow them from 100 to over 500 employees in less than two years. In September of 2016 he started at Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet company focused on making cities better through technology, and built the recruiting function and a small team. \n\nAt quickly growing startups, recruiting functions are often cobbled-together, making it challenging to make the necessary hires and thoughtfully grow a team. The upside is there is ample opportunity to learn about recruiting. In smaller companies without a full-time recruiting function, those in office and people management are often tasked with certain recruiting responsibilities. \n\nFor those new to the practice of recruiting, Jan offered guidance for building the right foundation. While he doesn’t believe there is one way of doing things that fits all companies or individuals, his insights can provide guidance to anyone interested in pursuing a career in recruiting or in improving the recruiting process at their company.  \n\n### It’s a process, treat it like one \n\n“Recruiting is, in many ways, an operations function. There’s a very clear set of stages that candidates and companies move through,” said Jan. “It’s a process, so treat it like one. Get the [software] systems to support your work.” \n\nEvery day, Jan’s calendar is packed full of meetings with team members, networking calls, phone interviews, rejection calls, email time, in-person interviews, and metrics reviews. Reviewing his schedule, it becomes clear that being a recruiter is not all about flashy searches for executive candidates or the power trip of constantly determining the fate of interview hopefuls. A large component of the work is administrative steps that take a lot of time, but need to be done correctly to move forward. \n\nJan insists that an applicant tracking system is essential to managing his time and decreasing the energy he spends on churn activities. It eliminates a lot of unnecessary emailing and time making spreadsheets. He also recommends having an email productivity suite to more efficiently reach out to multiple candidates and schedule or confirm interviews, among other features. \n\nEven if certain software and applications make the work easier, ultimately, you still need to have strong organizational skills and the ability to multitask. Still, Jan advises that anyone asked to to juggle multiple responsibilities and roles clearly communicate their workload and what they can manage well, or where corners have to be cut or timeframes re-evaluated.\n\n### Recruiting is a people business, so be human \n\nBy nature, there is an emotional imbalance in recruiting: for candidates, the process is typically more personal, because they open themselves up to evaluation. Jan stresses that it’s important to realize this and remember that efforts to communicate clearly and get back to candidates promptly can go a long way. \n\nAs with most jobs, you’ll have to do things that are uncomfortable. He emphasizes that it will be nerve-wracking to make your first rejection call informing a person they didn’t get the job, but the subsequent rejection calls will get easier. To grow as a recruiter, it’s important to embrace trial and error. Remember: even if you fumble a phone interview, or don’t set things up for an on-site interview in exactly the right way, strong candidates, more often than not, will still come through. \n\n“I think the great thing about getting into recruiting is that most of the time it’s not a very high-risk endeavor. There’s room to experiment, as long as others realize you genuinely care. Stakes become higher once you get to the offer stage,” he says. “Yet again, if you’ve done your job well in terms of treating it as a human endeavor, you should have the personal connection and the knowledge to navigate this step successfully, too.” \n\n### Act thoughtfully and structure your interview process \n\nWhen it comes to the interview itself, Jan is a strong advocate of structured interviewing to create a consistent experience for all candidates. Almost everyone has experienced an unstructured interview, where interviewers come in unprepared and ask generic questions as they scan a candidate’s resume. Typically, those interviews are conversational, with no discernable focus, linger on the candidate’s experiences, and end up with repetitive questions for the interviewee. This approach has been shown to lead to inaccurate evaluation, as “go with the flow” conversation undermines proper evaluation and allows biases to run rampant.\n\nStructured interview processes, on the other hand, build on a clear articulation of the evaluation criteria. The process consistently assigns specific criteria and interview questions to different interviewers. For example, one interviewer might ask about a candidate's work and communication style, while another might ask about their experience with data analysis. Of course, each structured interview process must be tailored to suit the culture of the company and the needs of the role and hiring manager. Working within a predetermined structure drives greater objectivity, allows interviewers to get a sense for what “good” sounds like [across multiple candidates], and ensures that all candidates are asked the same types of questions, repeatedly assessing for the same qualities and skills.\n\nIf you want to implement a structured interview process, these are Jan’s steps: \n- Define what success looks like for the role\n- Identify the drivers of that success\n- Choose the appropriate assessment method and interviewers\n- Brief your interviewers\n- Debrief and discuss feedback after the interview\n\nFollowing these steps will help you make better hires more confidently, and will likely help you create a more diverse workplace: evaluating all candidates using the same, consistent standards is a key step towards eliminating bias.\n\n### Stay open to learning and serendipity\n\nFor people new to recruiting, there is a lot of reading and content out there to learn about the profession. Recruiting is a relatively young field that has absorbed practices from other fields, such as marketing, human resources, and sales. Jan encourages looking for inspiration from these fields and applying aspects of each in a meaningful way. \n\nIn recruiting, as in life, there should also be room for serendipity within the structure. Even though Jan describes his own mind as “German, structured, [obsessed with] process and engineering,” there is one major part of his life that he came upon by pure chance. Eleven-and-a-half years ago he was traveling in Guatemala and ended up on a bus where he met the American woman who is now his wife. Their relationship crossed continents for years while they both finished school and took different jobs. This put Jan on the path that ultimately led to recruiting and to Sidewalk Labs. \n\n“It’s the one thing in my life that that, as a rational German, I cannot rationally explain,” says Jan, smiling. “It was only because I was behaving irrationally that morning that I ended up on that bus. I was lucky.”\n\n*Photography by Tavish Timothy*\n","cover":{"title":"Tavish Timothy - ah-sidewalk-4","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3NR3G9cm6QyaaokM2awoyy/2ed8ea5baf6e80bb787ba265d2382f35/Tavish_Timothy_-_ah-sidewalk-4.jpg","details":{"size":2121396,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"Tavish Timothy - ah-sidewalk-4.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"3NR3G9cm6QyaaokM2awoyy","featuredImage":{"title":"Tavish Timothy - ah-sidewalk-2-cropped","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/2FqH0P2vugqoSSs8E2UIOO/3157b25e7cc422e0a05f40d264b8920e/Tavish_Timothy_-_ah-sidewalk-2-cropped.jpg","details":{"size":1358047,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1617}},"fileName":"Tavish Timothy - ah-sidewalk-2-cropped.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"2FqH0P2vugqoSSs8E2UIOO","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"5oWCdeqppKoo2SAA6oKEqg","name":"Kristen Felicetti","shortBio":"Kristen Felicetti is a Brooklyn-based writer.

What if, instead of another box of pizza for your happy hour, your company ordered Nigerian food, and in addition to a delicious meal, you got to experience a new cuisine and get to know the local business that serves it? \n\nWhat if every company lunch order supported independent restaurateurs, caterers, and food truck owners in your neighborhood, and broadened your pallet? This is part of the philosophy that drives <a href=\"https://www.foodtoeat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FoodtoEat</a>, a corporate catering concierge service that connects big business to local vendors, and local vendors to the steadiness and supply of the corporate catering game. “Catering is the holy grail for food trucks and food carts,” says Deepti Sharma, founder and CEO, “It’s predictable, it’s high-volume, and—crucial in places like New York—it’s a year-round business.” \n\nBack in 2011, inspired by a 20-minute wait for a to-die-for cookie at a food truck, Deepti started wondering about the cookie vendor, “Here’s this woman who had a great idea (bakery on wheels!), but the only way to access her food is to figure out where she was, walk up, wait in line, and use cash.” Deepti got curious and started interviewing food truck owners about the business issues they faced. “A lot of them didn’t see themselves as small business owners,” she said, “They said, ‘It’s just a job.’” But did it have to be “just a job?” Deepti saw an opportunity to help these small businesses stabilize and thrive.\n \nHer initial ordering platform struggled to get off the ground, but as FoodtoEat evolved the essential mission of supporting small vendors has stayed central to the company’s goals. In 2015, Deepti pivoted and launched a concierge catering service to give local food trucks and carts access to steady, large-scale, weatherproof gigs.\n\nToday, FoodtoEat has effectively become the sales and marketing team for local food vendors and restaurants too small to have their own teams. Storytelling is a big part of the marketing strategy. “When we tell the vendor story, it makes people more interested in the food that they’re eating, and makes them feel excited to support a local business,” says Deepti. <a href=\"http://semsom.com/Semsom/\" target=\"_blank\">Semsom</a>, the Lebanese sisters with the homemade hummus, are an example of the kind of local vendor that office managers are excited to support.\n\nAlthough secondary to the vendors’ bottom line, cultural education is a big piece of the success pie for FoodtoEat. “We want people to understand what’s out there,” says Deepti, “People can usually only name a few types of food: Mexican, Indian, Thai, Chinese, and Japanese.” What about Nigerian cuisine? That’s where <a href=\"https://www.egunsifoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Egunsi Foods</a> comes in. Founder Yemisi mixes West African flavors (and works with West African vendors for her spices) and explores different African cuisines to help “normalize” these flavors for first-timers. What about Chinese food beyond lo mein? <a href=\"https://www.mr-bing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr Bing</a> is a newer FoodtoEat vendor that offers savory crepes, a common street food in China that is still unfamiliar to many Americans. “China is a huge country and there are so many different kinds of cuisines! We want to bring something to our clients that’s out of the box.”\n\nFor large clients, FoodtoEat will even do small tastings to showcase less familiar flavors. “We try to explain everything so people know what to expect. Dishes like chicken and rice, which are available in many cultures, make people feel more comfortable about branching out.”\n\nFor Deepti, the mission of FoodtoEat is personal. “As a first-generation Indian American, I grew up with kids calling me a ‘smelly Indian kid,’ not understanding that my food has a specific flavor. I’d try to give them a taste but it took a while to convince kids that my culture was cool.” As a woman of color who grew up in Queens, Deepti is intensely aware that many food truck and cart owners are immigrants, and many are women. Helping them build their businesses is essential to the strength of the community. As small operations, many vendors don’t have the bandwidth to proactively pitch new catering clients, coordinate large orders, or integrate new technologies into their business. \n\nAs a middleman between corporate catering clients and local vendors, FoodtoEat can help an <a href=\"https://www.managedbyq.com/services#category-6\" target=\"_blank\">office manager</a> place a great meal order that their teams will enjoy. One can always go with a big chain, but, points out Deepti, “There are hundreds of awesome food vendors in your community, why not support them?” FoodtoEat does all the vetting, tasting, testing, and ordering. They make sure vendors are consistent, and ease the minds of office managers everywhere by ensuring that if they give a new vendor a try, that vendor can deliver big orders on time.\n\nOrdering into the office isn’t just a perk for employees, it’s also about creating a family-style meal that brings co-workers together who generally don’t get to talk to each other. “When you’re in line picking out food, you start talking about it. You ask each other questions, ‘have you ever had this before?’” Deepti adds, “We’re bring new experiences that can be shared with your coworkers and friends.” \n\nAnd what do the vendors get out of this arrangement? The bottom line! Consider <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamagyro-new-york\" target=\"_blank\">Mama Gyro</a>, a Greek vendor run by a mother and daughter team. Their operation grew from two small storefronts that could only serve about 50 to 70 people per meal to include a commissary kitchen thanks to a consistent increase in business from working with FoodtoEat. The more substantial space allowed them to take larger catering orders and serve up to 500 meals. In addition to helping to find their vendors clients, FoodtoEat assists with pricing, suggests small changes to optimize the business, and recommends marketing strategies. Maybe, for example, “Halal Cart” should rebrand to avoid being confused with other 700 Halal Carts in New York City.\n\nAs FoodtoEat expands beyond New York, Deepti wants to offer other services to the restaurant owners, caterers, and pop-up vendors they work with, such as social media and email marketing. She says to the vendors , “Let us do what we do best, market you and get you business, so you can do what you do best, make kickass food.”\n\n*Photography by Jeff Mertz*\n","cover":{"title":"FoodtoEat Feed Image","description":"by Jeff Mertz","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/2HnTZeEvVmUCQ4iYSmoQ4i/4d0205218c95109b5839878d1621964f/Deepti_Tasting-5.jpg","details":{"size":2468197,"image":{"width":2388,"height":1600}},"fileName":"Deepti_Tasting-5.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"2HnTZeEvVmUCQ4iYSmoQ4i","featuredImage":{"title":"Deepti Tasting-Feature","description":"by Jeff Mertz","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/4F0yhikgOA68cuCcsiMkMQ/bebed5986eb6c9c6cc83c508b1f239cf/Deepti_Tasting-Feature.jpg","details":{"size":5967145,"image":{"width":2844,"height":3226}},"fileName":"Deepti_Tasting-Feature.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"4F0yhikgOA68cuCcsiMkMQ","category":{"id":"6gdaQCEYVySUIgAMEuIyeS","name":"In Profile","slug":"in-profile"},"author":{"id":"3TTunH46c0qcSEWOGacO2G","name":"Emily Heist Moss","shortBio":"Emily Heist Moss is the Director of Student Recruitment for a non-profit that teaches girls to code.

If you’re an office manager or administrative professional, you might think your school days are behind you, but with technology and the workplace constantly changing, it’s never a bad idea to consider sharpening your skills. Taking a class after work, enrolling in an online course, earning a certification, or another form of continuing education might just give you the edge you need when applying to your next position. If you plan to stay at your current company for awhile, professional development can be an additional way to demonstrate you’re an invaluable part of the team. Here's how continuing education can benefit you as an office professional. \n\n### Gain new skills or make sure the ones you have are up-to-date \n\n<a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/how-to-navigate-the-administrative-career-path-with-erica-ravich\" target=\"_blank\">Erica Ravich</a> worked as an Account Executive and Marketing Manager at Clarity Staffing in New York City, where she placed hundreds of candidates in administrative, human resources, accounting, finance, and marketing roles. While she stressed that having strong work experience and a “no task is too small” attitude are the most important factors when seeking an administrative support position, she spoke about how coursework in Microsoft Office or QuickBooks can be advantageous for certain roles. \n\n“If you’re going to pull from anything, I would say Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint),” said Erica. “Those are the skills that are probably most important, because there are companies that will test for those things. If they can see that you’re a power user, that’s great.”\n\nAs for QuickBooks, a growing number of office managers take on accounting tasks, whether it’s tracking vendor invoices or preparing payroll. If strong knowledge of QuickBooks isn’t already a requirement of the job, making sure you’re already familiar with the software will shorten your learning curve.  \n\nIn most areas around the country, you can enroll in Microsoft Office and QuickBooks courses at your local college or community center. Of course, online courses are also popular, allowing students to learn from anywhere and on their own schedule. Microsoft offers their own online training videos and certifications, as do online education companies like Lynda and Udemy. \n\nIf you’ve mastered Microsoft Office and QuickBooks, Barbara Weathers, Certification Manager at the <a href=\"http://www.iaap-hq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">International Association of Administrative Professionals</a> (IAAP), an organization that offers its own training and certification programs, recommended taking courses in cloud computing services and business writing. \n\n“Good business writing always comes up as one of the skills that is in the highest demand,” Barbara said. “Good proofreading, editing, and strong business communication skills are extremely important.” \n\n### Prove your relevancy to your employer and continue to make yourself invaluable\n\nAs with most positions, it’s important for any office manager or administrator to stay relevant and not become complacent about their career. Keeping up with the newest technology is a way you can make yourself invaluable to your current employer and, when you’re applying for your next job, certification in the latest software could be the line that makes you stand out from another candidate who has a similar resume. It also signals to prospective companies that you’re not coasting at your current position, which can be especially beneficial to communicate if you’ve been at the same company for five, ten, or even  twenty years. \n\nKemetia Foley, who works as a coordinator for one of the <a href=\"https://americanstaffing.net/\" target=\"_blank\">American Staffing Association’s</a> research teams, credits her certification with the IAAP for helping to keep her competitive in the workforce. In addition to obtaining certified professional administrative status through the IAAP, she pursued an additional designation in organizational management, which had an extensive exam process. IAAP also requires members to keep up with taking courses for their certification to remain active. \n\n“Certifications are popular because not only does a certification assess your knowledge and skill at a certain point in time, but it shows you’re going to stay up-to-date, because of the maintenance requirements,” said Barbara. “Certifications are different than other credentials, whether professional or academic, because they require you to continue with professional development activities to maintain that credential.”\n\nAnother benefit of continuing education is that many employers will cover some or all of the costs if they see it as a mutually beneficial opportunity for both the employee and the company. When <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/squarefoot-jenni-klauder-office-manager-opera-singer\" target=\"_blank\">Jenni Klauder</a> worked as a community manager at SquareFoot, she took on smaller graphic design jobs that weren’t high priority for the design team, but still needed to be done, such as infographics for social media and an email newsletter. The company needed someone to fill that gap, and Jenni knew that she could do a better job with some actual graphic design training. \n\nJenni’s company sponsored her Photoshop training and she had helpful suggestions for office professionals approaching their companies about doing something similar. She said, “My advice would be to lay out exactly how you are dipping your toes into whatever the new area is (graphic design, digital marketing, etc.) and show that while you have the desire and the interest, there are certain aspects that are lacking and that you can't just teach yourself. Also, research the various options classes and prices, and present them at the same time. I gave my company a range of options.”\n\nSquareFoot and Jenni ultimately decided on a one-day, 8-hour crash course bootcamp-style with General Assembly. She found that the class was exactly what she needed to springboard her graphic design skills and demystify the software. It taught her enough of the basics and fundamentals so that she could continue to learn and teach herself. And crucially, this newfound expertise was also beneficial to her company. She could take some of the work off the design team, but now that work was of a high quality and with a faster delivery time. When SquareFoot’s UX/UI team rebranded their website, Jenni was able to significantly assist by updating the smaller, less significant infographics, emails, and collateral that still had the old branding. \n\n### Networking and personal opportunities  \n\nUniversity alumni networks exist so that graduates from the same alma mater can assist each other with job placement and career guidance. Continuing education is no different. Someone you meet in your next class or conference might become your friend, recommend the next great course for you to enroll in, refer you for a new job, or be the resource that saves you next time you’re scrambling to find the perfect vendor. And in the digital age, it’s much more likely you’ll stay in touch with these class connections, or the class might already have an established online network for you to join after the actual course is over.  \n\n“I always tell my peers, we’re only as strong and as valuable as our resource network. That’s the thing that’s going to save us the most time. We pitch in for each other all the time, it’s kind of like a little underground community,” said Kemetia. \n\nJuanita Hunter brings up another benefit of continuing education. Learning and education is not only a line on a resume, or a certification to impress your employer, but an investment in your own personal development. She took a certification exam with the IAAP while she was doing administrative work at a pediatric hospital. Her colleagues knew that she was enrolled and noticed a change in her leadership abilities. \n\n“My superiors and peers recognized the fact that I had a newfound confidence and that I was willing to volunteer more to handle special projects,” Juanita said. \n\nWhen the pediatric hospital decided to transfer their software from GroupWise over to Microsoft Office, her supervisor asked Juanita to coordinate training. She trained 125 of her fellow administrative professionals in the hospital, and she credits being part of the IAAP as the reason she was both entrusted and up for the task.  \n\nOffice managers and administrators spend the majority of their day juggling the jobs of three people at once and catering to everyone in the office’s needs. Allowing yourself to do something for your own benefit might be the strongest argument for professional development. Investing the time and often money (either yours, or your employer’s) to take a class in the software you’ve always wanted to learn, or to attend a conference with your peers across the country, are ways you can commit to nurturing your own career ambitions and to practice a kind of vocational self-care.\n\n*Photography by Melissa Morgan Wallbridge*\n","cover":{"title":"ProfessionalDevelopmentFeedMelissaWallbridge","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/1rku5tF2ZyIgSo8yc68W6a/0615833657648c0eb6dd277d6a04329c/2017_08_29_AllHands_0385.jpg","details":{"size":2499461,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"2017_08_29_AllHands_0385.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"1rku5tF2ZyIgSo8yc68W6a","featuredImage":{"title":"ProfessionalDevelopmentArticleMelissaWallbridge","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5eRQcNcNTiIUOIy6qaKGu0/ad18bdfa80bfd6d3971ff2e61c39d6cd/2017_08_29_AllHands_0287-2.jpg","details":{"size":2873026,"image":{"width":2122,"height":2400}},"fileName":"2017_08_29_AllHands_0287-2.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"5eRQcNcNTiIUOIy6qaKGu0","category":{"id":"5JOHUh9UXYGeOgICqoGEOi","name":"Career Focus","slug":"career-focus"},"author":{"id":"5oWCdeqppKoo2SAA6oKEqg","name":"Kristen Felicetti","shortBio":"Kristen Felicetti is a Brooklyn-based writer.

In an ideal world, you'll have six months to confirm your new space, identify vendors, and lay the foundation for a <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/office-move-with-matt-cherveny-datadog\" target=\"_blank\">well-organized move</a>. But real-life plans, as we all know, tend to be far more precarious; leases fall through, renovations run over time, and the office manager is usually the one coming up with a last-minute Plan B.\n\n\"I'd say a month to a month and a half is a solid amount of time for a move, but you have to dedicate a lot to it,\" says <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/jamie-gray-hired-building-a-global-operations-team\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Gray, Global Office Operations Manager at Hired</a>. Gray currently manages 12 offices worldwide and has facilitated somewhere between 15 to 20 commercial moves.\n\nYou'll want to create a tentative timeline for securing a reliable moving company (more on that in a bit), packing up your existing office, moving in, getting settled, and communicating the plans to your team. Before your head starts spinning, keep in mind that \"tentative\" is the operative word here. Timelines and details will evolve; Gray's best advice is to lean into the chaos and roll with the changes as much as you can.\n\n### Find the right moving company\n\nThe last place you want to cut corners is with the moving company. Do your research and connect with more than one company to compare prices and services. Gray usually gets three quotes from a variety of commercial moving companies.\n\n\"Really take inventory of everything you have, listing every single piece of furniture, all your kitchen equipment, and anything else you have,\" says Alessandro Ciari, Director of Communications for <a href=\"http://moversnotshakers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Movers, Not Shakers!</a>, an eco-friendly moving company that specializes in office moves. \"This is what's really going to help you get the most accurate quote.\"\n\nIf possible, scheduling a walkthrough of your new space is also a good idea. Reach out to the building management company beforehand regarding any important details. For example, will they let you move in on a weekday? If not, accessing the loading dock on a night or weekend may increase your expenses. \n\n### Open the lines of communication\n\nOpen and active communication is the best way to stave off mid-move surprises. To start the new relationship off on the right foot, Gray likes to set up a meeting with the new landlord soon after signing the lease.\n\n\"It's a great way to get a full information download from them and orient yourself with the building,\" she says. \"I also like to ask where other tenants go wrong and have bothered them so that we don't make the same mistakes or fall into patterns they don't like.\"\n\nFrom there, bring your team into the fold so that everyone's on the same page. Relay things like the new address, local transit, the date of the move, if you need volunteers, and any major changes to expect at the new space. The main objective is to brief everyone on the timeline, especially when it comes to deadlines for cleaning out personal workspaces. Just make sure the ink is dry on the lease before spilling the beans, which will minimize any potential confusion down the line.\n\n\"I recommend setting up a weekly or even twice-a-week move check-in with all your key stakeholders, from IT to the design team, to make sure everyone's  feeling good about the timeline and being flexible if need be,\" adds Gray.\n\n### Reach out to vendors\n\nThis one's a biggie. Start off by listing out every vendor you currently use, along with their contact information and price. This includes internet service providers, along with whoever handles your power, water, trash, gas, key cards, security alarms and so on. Will they be able to follow you to the new space? Are there any new services you need to lock down in your new building? These are details you'll want to get organized as soon as possible.\n\n\"About 50 percent of the time, we're able to keep our same vendors,\" says Gray. \"The thing that can catch some vendors is that bigger buildings require a Certificate of Insurance (COI), and different buildings have different dollar amounts they need covered through that.\"\n\nHired's last building in San Francisco had a $5 million COI. As a result, they lost a handful of vendors simply because they couldn't meet the COI requirements for the building. If that's the case, Gray says that the building manager can usually recommend vendors to fill in the gaps or you can work with Managed by Q to identify vendors that meet your needs. That said, it's a good idea to confirm COI details with your property management company no later than two weeks before the move.\n\n\"It's really important to go through a couple points of administration with the building as soon as possible, from acquiring Certificates of Insurance to reserving elevator slot times,\" adds Ciari.\n\nInsurance aside, one of the most important vendors to lock down is an Internet provider. According to Gray, it takes a lot of commercial buildings 90 days to get it up and running. \"It's not a flip of the switch, as one would expect.\"\n\nIn the end, it's one of many moving parts in a big-picture office move. As the old saying goes, the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. In that spirit, break your to-do list down into a realistic timeline, then tackle it bit by bit and use the <a href=\"http://be.managedbyq.com/office-moving-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Office Moves Made Easy</a> overview and checklist from Managed by Q to guide you.\n\n*Photography by Julia Robbs and Melissa Morgan Wallbridge*\n","cover":{"title":"OfficeMovesAllHandsFeedJuliaRobbs","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/2DgYn6JYLWaq68qoCgqskw/7758dc74278d82fcc9ba9a1915b65540/OfficeMovesAllHandsFeedJuliaRobbs.jpg","details":{"size":1529267,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1600}},"fileName":"OfficeMovesAllHandsFeedJuliaRobbs.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"2DgYn6JYLWaq68qoCgqskw","featuredImage":{"title":"OfficeMoveArticleImage","description":"By Melissa Morgan Wallrbridge","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5s6aiKWJkkK0Gocokuu4Iw/37a94fc9f941f85837d8c1df51d81584/2017_08_29_AllHands_0373-2.jpg","details":{"size":2224681,"image":{"width":2122,"height":2400}},"fileName":"2017_08_29_AllHands_0373-2.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"5s6aiKWJkkK0Gocokuu4Iw","category":{"id":"6Eoa1BnJkWS2CUaIssQAa8","name":"Hands On","slug":"hands-on"},"author":{"id":"2NTHSZfR0QYaMyIC2Gec0q","name":"Marianne Hayes","shortBio":"Marianne Hayes is a longtime writer, storyteller and devoted bookworm.

After a few months of working in Bay Area restaurants she decided she wanted to pursue professional opportunities in the city’s startup tech industry. She had a strong background in hospitality thanks to her waitressing experience, but she didn’t quite know how her experience would translate to a 9-to-5 office setting. She decided to focus on office management roles because felt like they would be a good fit for her background and she landed at BetterUp, where she started as the Office Manager and is now a People Operations Associate. \n\nBetterUp is a mobile-based performance coaching platform that brings personalized expert coaching to employees at all levels. Companies like Facebook, Capital One, Square, and TriNet have all partnered with BetterUp to develop the skills and behaviors necessary to maximize team performance, engagement, and retention.\n\nIn addition to their clients and the wider BetterUp community, the company takes extra care to focus on the development of their employees. Like many people in office operations roles, Lily balances multiple tasks daily and works with colleagues on the people and culture, operations, and facilities teams. Given her previous experience, the hospitality side of her job came naturally, whether it was hosting visitors, planning an event, or appeasing her coworkers when something was left out of a grocery run. But when it came to the managerial aspects of the role, Lily had to sharpen her skills quickly as the company experienced substantial growth. She had to learn to organize a whole company at various stages, whether it was 15 people or 50. \n\n“I feel very fortunate, because we really walk the walk here at BetterUp. I got a ton of support in learning the skills and tools that I needed to have to be successful in the role,” said Lily. \n\nOne major responsibility that tested Lily’s managerial skills was heading up the office’s move into a brand new space. While tackling an office move is practically a rite of passage for an office manager, BetterUp had started in a coworking space, so she had the extra challenge of renovating and setting up the company’s first permanent space. In their coworking space each team member had little more than their computers and a couple of books. In the new space, as she hung plastic to keep dust from the renovation area away from her colleagues’ desks and shouted over loud sand blasters used to redo the floors, Lily realized she was in over her head. She reached out to Liz Haughton at <a href=\"http://managedbyq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Managed by Q</a>, who arrived the next day. From then on, Lily credits Q for being an invaluable partner. \n\n“From sourcing appliances to major electronic installs, and regular nightly cleaning services, I would have been so lost without Q,” she said. “Eventually we brought in an interior designer and she helped me flesh out my vision for how to make BetterUp’s culture tangible in the space. Q was a partner in that process too. All the way from installing walls and appliances to eventually staffing our office warming party three months after we moved in.”\n\nWith guidance from BetterUp’s executives, Lily, the designer, and Managed by Q worked together to <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/tour-betterup-san-francisco-office\" target=\"_blank\">create a space that was on brand and representative of BetterUp’s company culture</a>. It was also an opportunity for the young company, which was founded in 2013, to express their values throughout their space. Many BetterUp team members, including the co-founders are avid readers, so an office library was a must. With the library “BetterUppers,” as they call themselves, can participate in lifelong learning, a key company value, while at work. \n\nWhen BetterUp committed to supporting their employees’ development, they didn’t neglect physical wellness. The company champions grit and continuously accepting challenges to grow. To represent these values in their office Lily had punching bags installed. A personal trainer named George comes to BetterUp to run workouts every Monday and Wednesday. \n\n“We want to support everybody’s personal development here. We believe that’s the only way you make professional gains,” said Lily. “When one of us is flourishing, the whole team gets stronger. So every decision we made about what to put in the office had those baselines in mind.”\n\n<a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/tour-betterup-san-francisco-office\" target=\"_blank\">Creating spaces for collaboration and giving and receiving support</a> was another requirement for BetterUp’s renovated offices. In the center of the office is a giant sectional couch that can be broken off into many different pieces. When a BetterUpper is struggling with a problem, they can get up from their desk and meet a coworker on a piece of the sectional to hash it out. \n\nBeyond the new office, Lily took on recruiting efforts with Susan Hwang, BetterUp’s Head of People, and created culture initiatives that unite the company. Half the company works remotely, which creates a unique challenge when working to unite their culture. To help support everyone on their team Lily worked with Susan to create anniversary and birthday gifts for all employees, which ensure that everyone is getting the same recognition. The one-year anniversary gift is a branded notebook that lists the person’s top five strengths. The entire company takes time to write notes to the employee based on how they’ve seen his or her strengths shine through in everyday working life. \n\nAnother way Lily unifies the culture of BetterUp for both the remote and onsite workers is taking her role in planning for offsite retreats seriously. <a href=\"https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/effective-offsite-meetings-retreats\" target=\"_blank\">Retreats can be an innovative way to build team cohesion and strengthen work relationships</a>, especially when they are the only occasions everyone gets to interact face-to-face. BetterUp has semiannual retreats, with this summer’s being held in nearby Santa Cruz. The aim of any culture initiative is to get team members thinking with fresh perspectives and out of their comfort zones. Lily finds that the retreats are a great way to accomplish those things, but also believes she still doesn’t have it all figured out. New proposals are always in the works. \n\nLily stressed, “How we express our culture and support our employees is ever-evolving. And we kind of hope it stays that way. The worst thing that could happen would be a routine that totally eliminates creativity and divergent thinking.”\n\n*Photography by <a href=\"http://williamperls.com/\" target=\"_blank\">William Perls</a>*\n","cover":{"title":"LilyRooseveltBetterUpWilliamPerls","description":"Photo by William Perls","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5DuSboyPgQCKOiUawaeYMm/110decd097505e48d06da0566fb22d13/022-DSC08326.jpg","details":{"size":2839326,"image":{"width":2400,"height":1601}},"fileName":"022-DSC08326.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"coverId":"5DuSboyPgQCKOiUawaeYMm","featuredImage":{"title":"LilyRooseveltBetterUpWilliamPerlsArticle","description":"Photo by William Perls","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/4TMNkztbuUq8QK0sQ2CcQA/334aaa4fab6751fc93b433d6333776d2/032-DSC08546.jpg","details":{"size":2057970,"image":{"width":1420,"height":1608}},"fileName":"032-DSC08546.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}},"featuredImageId":"4TMNkztbuUq8QK0sQ2CcQA","category":{"id":"6gdaQCEYVySUIgAMEuIyeS","name":"In Profile","slug":"in-profile"},"author":{"id":"5oWCdeqppKoo2SAA6oKEqg","name":"Kristen Felicetti","shortBio":"Kristen Felicetti is a Brooklyn-based writer.

Depending who’s behind it, the purpose, methods, and effectiveness of everyday surveillance can vary widely, as well as the rules for doing so; in most places, such privacy laws are just starting to evolve. \n\nThanks to the spread of ever-more sophisticated and affordable options surveillance and data collection in the workplace has grown up along with the technology. Yesterday’s time clocks, magnetic-style swipe cards, and security cameras, which registered our comings and goings for anyone who bothered to check, have become today’s <a href=\"http://www.vocativ.com/414570/workplace-spying-surveillance-dystopia-we-work-in/\" target=\"_blank\">fingerprint-scanners</a> and location-tracking <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-14/new-office-sensors-know-when-you-leave-your-desk\" target=\"_blank\">software or sensors</a>; annual physicals and questionnaires have evolved into a constant stream of health data collected by <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-wearables-wellness-programs-1113-biz-20161111-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">employer-sponsored health trackers</a>. \n\nWhen it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/corporate-surveillance-activists/406201/\" target=\"_blank\">private employers</a>, most are free to keep an electronic eye trained on employees and their activities, so long as it’s on the clock; in some cases, companies have even been allowed to digitally <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/worker-fired-for-disabling-gps-app-that-tracked-her-24-hours-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\">follow them home</a>. And while it’s no secret that most employers are monitoring their workers on the job, many aren’t aware of just how their day is being tracked, nor what they or their employer might hope to gain—or stand to lose. \n\nProponents of employee monitoring argue that it enables greater productivity, security, and even harmony at the workplace than we’ve been used to. For jobs involving sales or a high level of customer service, software that tracks employee performance and interactions has increasingly been used as a supervisory and <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/297215\" target=\"_blank\">training tool</a>, helping to identify or automatically refer opportunities for further service, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/10/in-praise-of-electronically-monitoring-employees\" target=\"_blank\">prevent theft</a>, or make note of when a job’s done well.\n\nAccording to the creators and users of such software, that sort of data-crunching can also offer macro-level insights for <a href=\"https://www.business.com/articles/11-tools-for-tracking-your-remote-staffs-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\">streamlining</a> or developing businesses, and find meaning that human managers don’t have the time or processing power to pursue. Of course, for an employee whose company contributions don’t always show up well on paper, it can make for a stressful day; in certain industries, such pressure can also force employees to put their <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/04/17/303770907/to-increase-productivity-ups-monitors-drivers-every-move\" target=\"_blank\">own safety at risk</a>.\n\nIn many offices, employers have similarly targeted productivity with software that monitors workers’ activity on company computers and networks — whether by <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/employer-gps-tracking/512294/\" target=\"_blank\">logging their keystrokes</a> or time spent on social media sites (or other forbidden ones), scanning emails for certain keywords, or periodically taking snapshots of what workers have onscreen. If you’re the kind of worker who needs a Twitter or gaming break every so often to keep creative juices flowing, or who’s trying to create connections on dating sites while at work, this kind of surveillance can obviously lead to some embarrassment, assuming you become aware of it, or to professional comeuppance. \n\nAt some companies, methods for employee monitoring at the office have even branched out to include the body. A firm called Humanyze has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/09/07/this-employee-badge-knows-not-only-where-you-are-but-whether-you-are-talking-to-your-co-workers/?utm_term=.da4099d7c711\" target=\"_blank\">started equipping firms</a> with badges that register not only employees’ movements at the workplace, but also the duration and tone of conversations between coworkers, and physical indicators of employee mood. According to the technology’s creators, the badges can help companies understand how employees collaborate in shared workspaces, as well as explore how individuals experience and pass the day. \n\nEmployee monitoring has even entered the medical space in a growing number of companies, with <a href=\"https://qz.com/380634/this-is-how-fitbit-employees-monitor-each-others-health/\" target=\"_blank\">fitness trackers such as FitBit</a> playing a central role. In some cases, it’s part of an overall supervision scheme to make sure employees are performing at peak ability (and making conducive lifestyle choices), as demonstrated by at least one high-stakes <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgans-employee-surveillance-program-2015-4\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street operator</a>. \n\nIn other cases, employees have been encouraged or effectively compelled to provide their personal bio-feedback as part of company wellness programs, either to receive healthcare discounts or avoid penalties; soon, some may even be required to provide <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2017/03/14/gop-bill-could-force-employees-to-undergo-dna-testing-or-pay-thousands/#35c5a0ef71fe\" target=\"_blank\">their DNA</a>. Whether such wellness programs <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/03/15/corporate-health-wellness-programs/\" target=\"_blank\">actually work</a>, technologically enabled or otherwise, remains dubious. \n\nAs useful as all this data may be, however, privacy and employment experts urge companies to take responsibility for what they’re collecting, and consider the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/technology/workplace-surveillance-sees-good-and-bad.html\" target=\"_blank\">wide potential impacts</a> for their workers — whether the law requires it or not. \n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://daniels.du.edu/directory/corey-ciocchetti/\" target=\"_blank\">Corey Ciocchetti</a>, an attorney and assistant professor of Business Ethics and Legal Studies at the University of Denver’s Daniels College of Business, the issue of employee monitoring can be approached in two ways: from a legal standpoint, and that of ethics. \n\n“Ethically, the less monitoring of employees there is, the better,” he explained by phone. “Legally, some kind of balance is appropriate.”\n\nAs part of his research on the evolving intersections of business and law, Ciocchetti published a <a href=\"https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The_Eavesdropping_Employer_%20A_Twenty-First_Century_Framework.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive article</a> in 2011 on the scope of known employee monitoring practices, detailing everything from computer surveillance and location-tracking to social network, text message, and voicemail monitoring. He found that, in the absence of consistent laws regulating how employers can monitor their employees (and, in some states, effectively any laws at all), private companies have broadly helped themselves to whatever worker data they can, and frequently without informing workers they’re being watched.\n\n“The problem is that the way companies are gathering data on employees is all hidden, and if they do disclose, it’s all in legalese,” Ciocchetti said. “The way many companies are doing it now is sneaky: they’ll secretly collect information, and use it against an employee in a lawsuit. The ethical thing is to tell people what you’re going to do, and if they don’t want to participate, you’re going to find yourself with no employees.” \n\nCiocchetti stressed that making employees aware that they’re being watched isn’t just an ethical matter, but also a practical one. If workers know how companies are checking up on them during the day, they’re more likely to accept those conditions that benefit the group, and offer feedback on those that don’t. \n\n“During work hours, having a secure workplace is a good idea. That can include monitoring emails, which helps companies avoid intellectual property theft, as well as prevent liability and protect employees in cases of sexual harassment or violence.” Ciocchetti said he’s aware of numerous examples of when violent or sexually inappropriate content in an employee’s company email account was detected by their employers, either before or after such behavior was reportedly by a colleague.\n\n“Companies save themselves a lot of money that way, by catching inappropriate behavior through monitoring. But there has to be a balance — and when they monitor employees without telling them how they do it, it’s a real morale killer,” he said. \n\nRegarding privacy rules around how private companies can monitor workers, Ciocchetti pointed out that they’re typically made following instances of complaint from employees, sometimes after they’ve decided to move on. For this reason, and to ensure workers’ data won’t <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/12/technology/verizon-data-leaked-online/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">be exposed</a> or <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/17/castlight-pregnancy-data/\" target=\"_blank\">taken advantage of</a>, it’s vital that companies set their own standards for monitoring and privacy sooner rather than later, and do so in a way that lets employees be in on the arrangement.\n\n“The law is always retroactive, and I wouldn’t hope for congress to pass [a relevant privacy legislation] anytime soon,” he said. “So, states are eventually going to make 50 of them, which is burdensome for employers to navigate, whether or not they operate around the country. And in most cases, they defer to the most conservative stance on the issue — usually California’s.”\n\nWhen issues of privacy infringement do arise, it’s often the result of what smaller businesses have been doing, too, Ciocchetti said. “Not all of them know the law, and the technology to monitor employees is inexpensive.” Meanwhile, large firms with their (typically) proportionately large legal teams have mostly gone uncontested with wide-ranging employee monitoring programs, leaving individuals and privacy advocates holding a cache of unresolved concerns.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ciocchetti said (at which time he thinks companies should stop snooping, incidentally), both employees and employers should be in the habit of carefully considering the state of surveillance in the workplace, and the limits of their privacy. For workers, he recommended finding out what in-house monitoring practices are, and keeping personal activities limited to personal technology as much as possible: “If you want something to stay private, use your own email account on your own phone on your own network,” he said.\n\nFor employers, he advised honesty toward the people they’ve already agreed to trust with the business’ well-being (which, as it happens, enables their own). “Disclose what you’re monitoring, and let everyone be adults,” Ciocchetti said.\n\nAnd if, as an employer, you’re still not sure which methods of monitoring are right for your office, you can always just ask your employees — be it through an ID-verified online poll or the humble suggestion box.\n\nAfter all, your employees’ highly evolved processing abilities — and not their data — is what you’re paying them for.\n\n*Illustration by Tin Nguyen*\n","cover":{"title":"DataOffice by Tin Nguyen","description":"By Tin Nguyen for Managed by Q","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/5eJAOLWJIAYec4wC2wQaaQ/a5ea5eb5ba997c07feaf766624c26a1a/mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1200x800.png","details":{"size":1030949,"image":{"width":1200,"height":800}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1200x800.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"coverId":"5eJAOLWJIAYec4wC2wQaaQ","featuredImage":{"title":"DataOffice 1422x1608 by Tin Nguyen","description":"By Tin Nguyen for Managed by Q","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/3kyzHt1EyIyWOg4G2CiQuC/dfdc9dc6933007ba8b90ef484edc3bfc/mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1422x1608.png","details":{"size":761266,"image":{"width":1422,"height":1608}},"fileName":"mbq_ah_009_DataOffice_1422x1608.png","contentType":"image/png"}},"featuredImageId":"3kyzHt1EyIyWOg4G2CiQuC","category":{"id":"60gJDY8k6Is2GOmEES6KoI","name":"The Effortless Office","slug":"effortless-office"},"author":{"id":"3F7RaR6BMAKCEMGImyWqoQ","name":"Janet Burns","shortBio":"Janet is a freelance writer living in Brooklyn, NY, and can be found via warmlyjanetburns.com.","headshotId":"320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ","headshotImage":{"title":"Janet Burns author photo","description":"Janet Burns author photo","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/smz5wodwjls6/320iLeOdyE8oQ6m0I0E8wQ/461a2f17b03ecc8818a0e627efb3a601/park_headshot.jpg","details":{"size":544905,"image":{"width":1364,"height":1364}},"fileName":"park headshot.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"slideshowImages":[]}],"article":{},"isLoading":false,"articlesFetching":false},"navigation":{"largeHeader":true,"visible":false,"emailPopupVisible":false,"totalArticles":62,"currentPage":1,"headerBackground":"white"},"routing":{"locationBeforeTransitions":null}};
