<h4>14.   GENERAL PROVISIONS.</h4>
<p><strong>14.1</strong>        Modification of Terms.  Managed by Q may amend or modify these Terms from time to time. Managed by Q may, at its sole discretion, provide Customer with written notice of any such changes, revisions, amendments or modifications, provided, however that any such changes, revisions, amendments or modifications shall become effective without any further action by any party and that they shall not apply to any Agreement prior to the effective date of such changes, revisions, amendments or modifications. Managed By Q may modify these Terms or any additional Terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the Services. You should look at the Terms regularly. Managed By Q will post notice of modifications to these Terms on this page.  Managed By Q will notify you when its Terms have been updated.  Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than thirty days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.  If you do not agree to the modified Terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service and provide notice to Managed By Q.</p>
<p>If there is a conflict between these Terms and the additional Terms, the additional Terms will control for that conflict.</p>
<p>If you do not comply with these Terms, and Managed By Q  does not take action right away, this doesn’t mean that Managed By Q is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future).  If it turns out that a particular Term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other Terms.</p>
<p><strong>14.2</strong>        Assignment.  Neither party may assign any Agreement or any other contract with Managed by Q or any of its rights or obligations without the express prior written consent of Managed by Q.  Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void.  No assignment or delegation relieves Customer of any of its obligations under these Terms and/or an Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties’ permitted successors and assigns.</p>
<p><strong>14.3</strong>        Governing Law.  These Terms, all Agreements and all claims arising in connection with any Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts of law principles thereof.</p>
<p><strong>14.4</strong>        Dispute Resolution.  To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), the Customer and Managed by Q agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon receipt of a written notice by the other party from the party asserting a claim.</p>
<p>Managed by Q takes Disputes seriously and will work to investigate any claims made.  In the event of any Dispute resulting from a claim of theft by one of Managed by Q’s employees or contractors, the Customer agrees to notify Managed by Q immediately. Managed by Q shall investigate such matter and may work with private investigators and the policy as it deems necessary. The Customer shall share any supporting evidence with Managed by Q or any investigative body.</p>
<p>If the Customer and Managed by Q are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service or Software (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding individual arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. THE CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The Customer’s arbitration fees and share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law.</p>
<p>All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the Dispute with the same remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to the Customer and shall not affect any other customer.  The Customer and Managed by Q agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in the Customer’s or Managed by Q’s respective individual capacities and in so doing the Customer and Managed by Q  hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration (either as a named-plaintiff or class member), and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind.  If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.</p>
<p>The foregoing arbitration agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act. The terms of the arbitration agreement provisions shall survive after this Agreement terminates or the Customer’s use of the Service ends.  Except as set forth above, if any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p>Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in New York, New York, with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.  It is the parties’ intent that this Agreement be construed to the fullest extent allowed by law, such that the only exceptions shall be for claims under California’s Private Attorney General Act (Cal. Lab. Code § 2698, et seq.) or as otherwise required by non-waivable provisions of applicable law.</p>
<p>Arbitration will take place in New York, New York.</p>
<p><strong>14.5</strong>        Injunctive Relief.  In the event of a violation or threatened violation of Sections 4, 7 and/or 13 by Customer, Managed by Q shall have the right, in addition to such other remedies as may be available to it at law or pursuant to these Terms, to temporary or permanent injunctive relief enjoining such act or threatened act in any court of competent jurisdiction without any requirement to post a bond or provide other security.  The parties acknowledge and agree that the legal remedies for such violations or threatened violations are inadequate and that Managed by Q would suffer irreparable harm.</p>
<p><strong>14.6</strong>        Waiver of Jury Trial.  The parties hereby irrevocably waive their right to a trial by jury in any litigation in any court with respect to any claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or in connection with any Agreement or these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>14.7</strong>        Notices.  All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications required or permitted under these Terms and/or any Agreement shall be in writing and delivered in person, by electronic transmission including email (provided receipt shall have been acknowledged in writing by the recipient thereof), by overnight delivery service, or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid with return receipt requested. All communications for Managed by Q must be sent to Managed by Q, Attn.: Legal Department, 161 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10013 and to the Customer at the address provided by the Customer at the time of registration, or to such other address that may be designated by the respective parties in writing from time to time.</p>
